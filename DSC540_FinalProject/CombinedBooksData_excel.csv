Clarissa, the wife of a Foreign Office diplomat, is given to daydreaming. 'Supposing I were to come down one morning and find a dead body in the library, what should I do?' she muses. Clarissa has her chance to find out when she discovers a body in the drawing-room of her house in Kent. Desperate to dispose of the body before her husband comes home with an important foreign politician, Clarissa persuades her three house guests to become accessories and accomplices. It seems that the murdered man was not unknown to certain members of the house party (but which ones?), and the search begins for the murderer and the motive, while at the same time trying to persuade a police inspector that there has been no murder at all... SPIDER'S WEB was written in 1954 specifically for Margaret Lockwood and opened first at the Theatre Royal Nottingham before moving to the Savoy Theatre in London on 14 December 1954.

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can't catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman's new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman's nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears. At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, an homage to 1940s noir, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, The Yiddish Policemen's Union is a novel only Michael Chabon could have

There are situations in which we fail for a moment to recognize the person we are with, in which the identity of the other is erased while we simultaneously doubt our own. That also happens with couples -- indeed, above all with couples, because lovers fear more than anything else ""losing sight"" of the loved one. With stunning artfulness in expanding and playing variations on the meaningful moment, Milan Kundera has made this situation -- and the vague sense of panic it inspires -- the very fabric of his new novel. Here brevity goes hand in hand with intensity, and a moment of bewilderment marks the start of a labyrinthine journey during which the reader repeatedly crosses the border between the real and the unreal, between what occurs in the world outside and what the mind creates in its solitude.

A man persecuted by the ghosts of his painful past. A young woman searching for happiness. In one eventful week, each will face questions of life, death, and power, and each will choose a path. Will they choose good or evil? In the remote village of Viscos -- a village too small to be on any map, a place where time seems to stand still -- a stranger arrives, carrying with him a backpack containing a notebook and eleven gold bars. He comes searching for the answer to a question that torments him: Are human beings, in essence, good or evil? In welcoming the mysterious foreigner, the whole village becomes an accomplice to his sophisticated plot, which will forever mark their lives. Paulo Coelho's stunning novel explores the timeless struggle between good and evil, and brings to our everyday dilemmas fresh perspective: incentive to master the fear that prevents us from following our dreams, from being different, from truly living.

I was too scared to even look at my father. I didn't want to see the disappointment and horror on his face. All that hate I had accumulated for him over the years, all the resentment against him for not understanding what I was going through, just released with the tears. ""So, where are your parents?"" the stewardess asked me after a few minutes. ""I can't wait here with you much longer."" I looked up and wiped my eyes. My father was standing ten feet away. He didn't even recognize me. In the underbelly of Las Vegas, a cesspool of warring biker gangs and seedy strip clubs transformed the gawky, brace-faced Jenna Massoli into the bombshell Jenna Jameson. Today, Jenna Jameson is the biggest star in the history of adult movies, consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful women alive. But behind the glamour and the meteoric rise to fame was a path paved with tragedy and heartbreak. As a teenager drawn into a chaotic world ruled by rape, abuse, and murder, Jenna plunged into a downward spiral of addiction, even as she became one of the most photographed women in adult magazines. Determined to overcome this past, Jenna rebounded in the adult-film business, where she encountered sadistic directors, experienced lovers of both sexes, amorous celebrities (from Howard Stern to Marilyn Manson to Tommy Lee), bitter rival starlets, and finally, glory, as she went on to become the biggest porn star the world has ever seen. But her struggle for happiness did not end when the accolades began. For years she wrestled with her resentment at her estranged father, the loneliness of growing up from the age of two without a mother, and her enduring childhood desire to find a man who could give her the security and love she never had. Her unforgettable memoir is many things at once: a shocking sexual history, an insider's guide to the secret workings of the billion-dollar adult-film industry, and a gripping thriller that probes deep into Jenna's dark past. An unparalleled exploration of sexual freedom, How to Make Love Like a Porn Star ventures far beyond the flesh, into the heart-shredding tragedies and adrenaline-pumping triumphs of a woman who has already lived a hundred lifetimes. Always witty and humorous even as she faces the demons of her past, Jenna offers hilarious anecdotes about one of the most controversial businesses in history, and shares outrageous advice, including her ten commandments of dating and sex, how to become a ""suitcase pimp,"" and how to make it in the business as a female (or a male). Add to this never-before-seen photographs from Jenna's private collection and others taken exclusively for this book, and the result is certain to be one of the most talked-about books of the year.",2004.0,3.75,592.0,10211.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, Collins and Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies -- they have an average age of nearly one hundred years and have outperformed the general stock market by a factor of fifteen since 1926 -- and studied each company in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day -- as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: ""What makes the truly exceptional companies different from other companies?"" What separates General Electric, 3M, Merck, Wal-Mart, Hewlett-Packard, Walt Disney, and Philip Morris from their rivals? How, for example, did Procter & Gamble, which began life substantially behind rival Colgate, eventually prevail as the premier institution in its industry? How was Motorola able to move from a humble battery repair business into integrated circuits and cellular communications, while Zenith never became dominant in anything other than TVs? How did Boeing unseat McDonnell Douglas as the world's best commercial aircraft company -- what did Boeing have that McDonnell Douglas lacked? By answering such questions, Collins and Porras go beyond the incessant barrage of management buzzwords and fads of the day to discover timeless qualities that have consistently distinguished out-standing companies. They also provide inspiration to all executives and entrepreneurs by destroying the false but widely accepted idea that only charismatic visionary leaders can build visionary companies. Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the twenty-first century and beyond.",2004.0,3.98,368.0,49529.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's the question that has marine behavioral biologist Nate Quinn and his crew poking, charting, recording, and photographing very big, wet, gray marine mammals. Until the extraordinary day when a whale lifts its tail into the air to display a cryptic message spelled out in foot-high letters: Bite me. Trouble is, Nate's beginning to wonder if he hasn't spent just a little too much time in the sun. 'Cause no one else on his team saw a thing -- not his longtime partner, Clay Demodocus; not their saucy young research assistant; not even the spliff-puffing white-boy Rastaman Kona (né Preston Applebaum).

A story of love and fear -- of growth, discovery, and acceptance -- that becomes a profound personal and philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching and transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence . . . and the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward.",2006.0,3.77,540.0,157734.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7279374M/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance,/books/OL7279374M,540.0,,,HarperTorch,,"April 25, 2006","[{'name': 'Pirsig, Robert M.', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/pirsig,_robert_m.'}, {'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Description and travel', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/description_and_travel'}, {'name': 'Fathers and sons', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fathers_and_sons'}, {'name': 'Journeys', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/journeys'}, {'name': 'Maintenance and repair', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/maintenance_and_repair'}, {'name': 'Motorcycles', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/motorcycles'}, {'name': 'Nonfiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/nonfiction'}, {'name': 'Philosophy', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/philosophy'}, {'name': 'Philosophy and civilization', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/philosophy_and_civilization'}, {'name': 'Popular culture', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/popular_culture'}, {'name': 'Psychology', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/psychology'}, {'name': 'Self', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/self'}, {'name': 'Zen Buddhism and science', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/zen_buddhism_and_science'}, {'name': 'Conduct of life', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/conduct_of_life'}, {'name': 'Existentialism', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/existentialism'}, {'name': 'Travel', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/travel'}, {'name': 'Values', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/values'}, {'name': 'Social Values', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/social_values'}, {'name': 'Autobiography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/autobiography'}, {'name': '18.06 Anglo-American literature', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/18.06_anglo-american_literature'}, {'name': 'Zen buddhism', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/zen_buddhism'}, {'name': 'Motorcycles, maintenance and repair', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/motorcycles,_maintenance_and_repair'}, {'name': 'United states, description and travel', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/united_states,_description_and_travel'}, {'name': 'Christmas decorations', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/christmas_decorations'}, {'name': 'Handicraft', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/handicraft'}, {'name': 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/open_library_staff_picks'}, {'name': 'Essentialism (Philosophy)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/essentialism_(philosophy)'}, {'name': 'Pirsig, Robert M', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/pirsig,_robert_m'}, {'name': 'Pirsing, Robert M.', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/pirsing,_robert_m.'}]","[{'name': 'United States', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:united_states'}]",,['629'],['1008'],['0060589469'],['OL7279374M'],,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/31248-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/31248-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/31248-L.jpg,An Inquiry Into Values,,,,,Robert M.

Grant,The Unlikely Hero,Michael Korda,Biography & Autobiography,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rvaqxQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"One of the first two volumes in Harper's Eminent Lives series, Korda brings his acclaimed storytelling talents to the life of Ulysses S. Grant – a man who managed to end the Civil War on a note of grace, serve two terms as president, write one of the most successful military memoirs in American literature, and is today remembered as a brilliant general but a failed president. Ulysses S. Grant was the first officer since George Washington to become a four–star general in the United States Army, and the only president between Andrew Jackson and Woodrow Wilson to serve eight consecutive years in the White House. In this succinct and vivid biography, Michael Korda considers Grant's character and reconciles the conflicting evaluations of his leadership abilities. Grant's life played out as a true Horatio Alger story. Despite his humble background as the son of a tanner in Ohio, his lack of early success in the army, and assorted failed business ventures, his unwavering determination propelled him through the ranks of military leadership and into the presidency. But while the general's tenacity and steadfastness contributed to his success on the battlefield, it both aided and crippled his effectiveness in the White House. Assessing Grant both within the context of his time and in contrast to more recent American leaders, Korda casts a benevolent eye on Grant's presidency while at the same time conceding his weaknesses. He suggests that though the general's second term ended in financial and political scandals, the fact remains that for eight years Grant exerted a calming influence on a country that had only just emerged from a horrendous civil war. Ulysses S. Grant is an even–handed and stirring portrait of a man who guided America through a pivotal juncture in its history.",2004.0,3.88,176.0,410.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3304094M/Ulysses_S._Grant,/books/OL3304094M,161.0,161 p. ;,Michael Korda.,Atlas Books/HarperCollins,New York,2004,"[{'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Biography & Autobiography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography_&_autobiography'}, {'name': 'Case studies', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/case_studies'}, {'name': 'Generals', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/generals'}, {'name': 'Nonfiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/nonfiction'}, {'name': 'Political leadership', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/political_leadership'}, {'name': 'Presidents', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/presidents'}, {'name': 'United States', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/united_states'}, {'name': 'United States.

A little hapless, somewhat neurotic, sort of a hypochondriac. He's what's known as a Beta Male: the kind of fellow who makes his way through life by being careful and constant -- you know, the one who's always there to pick up the pieces when the girl gets dumped by the bigger/taller/stronger Alpha Male. But Charlie's been lucky. He owns a building in the heart of San Francisco, and runs a secondhand store with the help of a couple of loyal, if marginally insane, employees. He's married to a bright and pretty woman who actually loves him for his normalcy. And she, Rachel, is about to have their first child. Yes, Charlie's doing okay for a Beta. That is, until the day his daughter, Sophie, is born. Just as Charlie -- exhausted from the birth -- turns to go home, he sees a strange man in mint-green golf wear at Rachel's hospital bedside, a man who claims that no one should be able to see him. But see him Charlie does, and from here on out, things get really weird. . . . People start dropping dead around him, giant ravens perch on his building, and it seems that everywhere he goes, a dark presence whispers to him from under the streets. Strange names start appearing on his nightstand notepad, and before he knows it, those people end up dead, too. Yup, it seems that Charlie Asher has been recruited for a new job, an unpleasant but utterly necessary one: Death. It's a dirty job. But hey, somebody's gotta do it. Christopher Moore, the man whose Lamb served up Jesus' ""missing years"" (with the funny parts left in), and whose Fluke found the deep humor in whale researchers' lives, now shines his comic light on the undiscovered country we all eventually explore -- death and dying -- and the results are hilarious, heartwarming, and a hell of a lot of fun.",2006.0,4.07,387.0,88016.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3431684M/A_Dirty_Job,/books/OL3431684M,387.0,p. cm.,Christopher Moore.,William Morrow,New York,2006,"[{'name': 'Death', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/death'}, {'name': 'Hypochondria', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/hypochondria'}, {'name': 'Hypochondria in fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/hypochondria_in_fiction'}, {'name': 'Fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction'}, {'name': 'Fathers and daughters', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fathers_and_daughters'}, {'name': 'Fathers and daughters in fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fathers_and_daughters_in_fiction'}, {'name': 'Death in fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/death_in_fiction'}, {'name': 'Humor (Fiction)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/humor_(fiction)'}, {'name': 'Fiction, humorous, general', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_humorous,_general'}, {'name': 'San francisco (calif.), fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/san_francisco_(calif.),_fiction'}, {'name': 'Fiction, fantasy, contemporary', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_fantasy,_contemporary'}]","[{'name': 'San Francisco (Calif.)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:san_francisco_(calif.)'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/dirtyjob00moor', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3431684M/A_Dirty_Job/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['33456'],['6467477'],['0060590270'],['OL3431684M'],"['PS3563.O594 D57 2006', 'PS3563.O594D57 2006']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8287392-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8287392-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8287392-L.jpg,A Novel,,['2005057501'],['62326926'],['813/.6'],,,['9780060590277'],,,,,,,,,,

Situating Jefferson within the context of America's evolution and tracing his legacy over the past two hundred years, Hitchens brings the character of Jefferson to life as a man of his time and also as a symbolic figure beyond it. Conflicted by power, Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence and acted as Minister to France yet yearned for a quieter career in the Virginia legislature. Predicting that slavery would shape the future of America's development, this professed proponent of emancipation elided the issue in the Declaration and continued to own human property. An eloquent writer, he was an awkward public speaker; a reluctant candidate, he left an indelible presidential legacy. Jefferson's statesmanship enabled him to negotiate the Louisiana Purchase with France, doubling the size of the nation, and he authorized the Lewis and Clark expedition, opening up the American frontier for exploration and settlement. Hitchens also analyzes Jefferson's handling of the Barbary War, a lesser-known chapter of his political career, when his attempt to end the kidnapping and bribery of Americans by the Barbary states, and the subsequent war with Tripoli, led to the building of the U.S. navy and the fortification of America's reputation regarding national defense. In the background of this sophisticated analysis is a large historical drama: the fledgling nation's struggle for independence, formed in the crucible of the eighteenth-century Enlightenment, and, in its shadow, the deformation of that struggle in the excesses of the French Revolution. This artful portrait of a formative figure and a turbulent era poses a challenge to anyone interested in American history -- or in the ambiguities of human nature.",2005.0,3.92,188.0,2181.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL17154864M/Thomas_Jefferson,/books/OL17154864M,188.0,"xiv, 188 p. ;",Christopher Hitchens,Atlas Books/HarperCollinsPublishers,New York,2005,"[{'name': 'Presidents', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/presidents'}, {'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Biography & Autobiography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography_&_autobiography'}, {'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'Nonfiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/nonfiction'}, {'name': 'Jefferson, Thomas, -- 1743-1826', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/jefferson,_thomas,_--_1743-1826'}, {'name': 'Influence', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/influence'}, {'name': 'Politics and government', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/politics_and_government'}, {'name': 'Large type books', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/large_type_books'}, {'name': 'nyt:e-book-nonfiction=2016-02-28', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/nyt:e-book-nonfiction=2016-02-28'}, {'name': 'New York Times bestseller', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/new_york_times_bestseller'}, {'name': 'Jefferson, thomas, 1743-1826', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/jefferson,_thomas,_1743-1826'}, {'name': 'United states, politics and government, 1783-1809', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/united_states,_politics_and_government,_1783-1809'}]","[{'name': 'United States', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:united_states'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/thomasjeffersona00hitc', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL17154864M/Thomas_Jefferson/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['43370'],['206341'],['0060598964'],['OL17154864M'],['E332 .H66 2005b'],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8101327-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8101327-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/8101327-L.jpg,author of America,,['2005296593'],['60525341'],,Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826),"BORN ON APRIL 13, 1743 (April 2 until the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1758), Thomas Jefferson was the offspring of stable planter stock in the native aristocracy of Virginia.",,,,,,,,,,,

There is more historical data on his life than on that of the founder of any other major faith, and yet his story is little known. Karen Armstrong's immaculately researched new biography of Muhammad will enable readers to understand the true origins and spirituality of a faith that is all too often misrepresented as cruel, intolerant, and inherently violent.

Borg,Religion,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=-_ieWUhA6V4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"Of the many recent books on the historical Jesus, none has explored what the latest biblical scholarship means for personal faith. Now, in Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time, Marcus Borg addresses the yearnings of those who want a fully contemporary faith that welcomes rather than oppresses our critical intelligence and openness to the best of historical scholarship. Borg shows how a rigorous examination of historical findings can lead to a new faith in Christ, one that is critical and, at the same time, sustaining. ""Believing in Jesus does not mean believing doctrines about him,"" Borg writes. ""Rather, it means to give one's heart, one's self at its deepest level, to . . . the living Lord."" Drawing on his own journey from a naive, unquestioning belief in Christ through collegiate skepticism to a mature and contemporary Christian faith, Borg illustrates how an understanding of the historical Jesus can actually lead to a more authentic Christian life—one not rooted in creeds or dogma, but in a life of spiritual challenge, compassion, and community. In straightforward, accessible prose, Borg looks at the major findings of modern Jesus scholarship from the perspective of faith, bringing alive the many levels of Jesus' character: spirit person, teacher of alternative wisdom, social prophet, and movement founder. He also reexamines the major stories of the Old Testament vital to an authentic understanding of Jesus, showing how an enriched understanding of these stories can uncover new truths and new pathways to faith. For questioning believers, doubters, and reluctant unbelievers alike, Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time frees our understanding of Jesus' life and message from popular misconceptions and outlines the way to a sound and contemporary faith: ""For ultimately, Jesus is not simply a figure of the past, but a figure of the present. Meeting that Jesus—the living one who comes to us even now—will be like meeting Jesus again for the first time.""",1995.0,4.14,160.0,3998.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9780060609191,0060609192,Reading the Bible Again for the First Time,Taking the Bible Seriously but Not Literally,Marcus J. Borg,Religion,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pf0mlwEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"One of the vital challenges facing thoughtful people today is how to read the Bible faithfully without abandoning our sense of truth and history. Reading the Bible Again for the First Time provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts. This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined—in an approach the author calls ""historical-metaphorical."" Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible's origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become. Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective. This unique book invites everyone—whatever one's religious background—to engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.",2002.0,4.13,321.0,2875.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jolted out of his comfortable routine, Merton is forced to reassess his need for love and his commitment to celibacy and the monastic vocation.This astonishing volume traces Merton’s struggle to reconcile his unexpected love with his sacred vows while continuing to grapple with the burning social issues of the day – including racial conflicts, the war in Vietnam, and the Arab-Israeli conflict – visiting and corresponding with high-profile friends like Thich Nhat Hanh and Joan Baez, and further developing his writing career. Revealing Merton to be ‘very human’ in his chronicles of the ecstasy and torment of being in love, Learning to Love comes full circle as Merton recommits himself completely and more deeply to his vocation even as he recognizes ‘my need for love, my loneliness, my inner division, the struggle in which solitude is at once a problem and a ‘solution’. And perhaps not a perfect solution either’ (11 May, 1967).",1998.0,4.5,382.0,15.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

John ""Red"" Shea was a top lieutenant in the South Boston Irish mob, rising to this position at the age of twenty-one. Thus began his tutelage under the notorious Irish godfather James ""Whitey"" Bulger. An ice-cold enforcer with a legendary red-hot temper, Shea was a legend among his Southie peers in the 1980s. From the first delivery truck he robbed at thirteen to the start of his twelve-year federal sentence for drug trafficking at twenty-seven, Shea was a portrait in American crime -- a terror, brutal and ruthlessly ambitious. Drug dealer, loan shark, money launderer, and multimillion-dollar narcotics kingpin, Shea was at the pinnacle of power -- until the feds came knocking and eventually obliterated the legendary mob in a well-orchestrated sweep of arrests, fueled by insider tips to the FBI and DEA. While Bulger's other top men turned informant to save their own hides, Shea alone kept his code of honor and his mouth shut -- loyalty that earned him a dozen years of hard time even as the man he was protecting turned out to be, himself, a rat. For in the end, in a remarkable show of betrayal, Bulger turned out to be the FBI's ""main man"" and top informant -- tipping off the feds for decades while still managing to operate one of the most murderous and profitable organized crime outfits of all time. In Rat Bastards, Shea brings that mysterious world and gritty urban Irish American street culture into sharp focus by telling his own story -- of his fatherless upbringing, his apprenticeship on the tough streets of Southie, and his love affair with trouble, boxing, and then the gangster life. In prose that is refreshingly honest, personal, and surprisingly tender, Shea tells his harrowing, unflinching, and unapologetic story. A man who did the crime, did the time, and held fast to the Irish code of silence, which he was raised to follow at any cost, Shea remains a man of honor and in doing so has become a living legend. One of the last of a dying breed, a true stand-up guy. Shea expects no forgiveness and makes no excuses for the life he chose. His story is intense, compelling, and in your face.",2006.0,3.51,304.0,34.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But much less attention has been paid to his monarchy, especially the closing years of his reign. Rich with information including details from new archival material and written with the nail-biting suspense of a modern thriller, The Last Days of Henry VIII offers a superb fresh look at this fascinating figure and new insight into an intriguing chapter in history. Robert Hutchinson paints a brilliant portrait of this egotistical tyrant who governed with a ruthlessness that rivals that of modern dictators; a monarch who had ""no respect or fear of anyone in this world,"" according to the Spanish ambassador to his court. Henry VIII pioneered the modern ""show trial"": cynical propaganda exercises in which the victims were condemned before the proceedings even opened, proving the most powerful men in the land could be brought down overnight. After thirty-five years in power, Henry was a bloated, hideously obese, black-humored old recluse. And despite his having had six wives, the Tudor dynasty rested on the slight shoulders of his only male heir, the nine-year-old Prince Edward -- a situation that spurred rival factions into a deadly conflict to control the throne. The Last Days of Henry VIII is a gripping and compelling history as fascinating and remarkable as its subject.",2005.0,4.14,368.0,1460.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sound of the island's destruction was heard in Australia and India and on islands thousands of miles away. Most significant of all -- in view of today's new political climate -- the eruption helped to trigger in Java a wave of murderous anti-Western militancy among fundamentalist Muslims, one of the first outbreaks of Islamic-inspired killings anywhere.

Who was ""just seventeen"" and made Paul's heart go ""boom""? Was there really an Eleanor Rigby? Where's Penny Lane? In A Hard Day's Write, music journalist Steve Turner shatters many well-worn myths and adds a new dimension to the Fab Four's rich legacy by investigating for the first time the ordinary people and events immortalized in the Beatles' music and now occupying a special niche in popular culture's collective imagination. Arranged chronologically by album, the book breaks new ground by exploring how private incidents influenced the group's writing and how their music evolved. Turner reveals that Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was really a drawing by Julian Lennon of his childhood friend; Bungalow Bill was an all-American tiger hunter; Doctor Robert was a New York 'speech doctor'; and much more. A longtime Beatles admirer, Turner tracked down and interviewed the real-life subjects of the songs, probed public records and newspaper archives, and spoke in depth to the people closet to the Beatles to unearth tales that have never before been made public. The result is a book that chronicles an untold story of the Beatles themselves. Illustrated with over 200 photographs, A Hard Day's Write is a visually alluring and highly entertaining journey to the land stretching just beneath your conscious mind, mapped out with strawberry fields, fool-topped hills, and long and winding roads.",2005.0,4.18,224.0,152.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7282915M/A_Hard_Day's_Write_3e,/books/OL7282915M,224.0,,,Harper Paperbacks,,"October 18, 2005","[{'name': 'Beatles', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/beatles'}, {'name': 'Analysis, appreciation', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/analysis,_appreciation'}, {'name': 'History and criticism', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history_and_criticism'}, {'name': 'Rock musicians', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/rock_musicians'}, {'name': 'Rock music', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/rock_music'}, {'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Music, instruction and study', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/music,_instruction_and_study'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/harddayswritesto0000turn_a2y5', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': ""https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7282915M/A_Hard_Day's_Write_3e/borrow"", 'checkedout': False}]",['35552'],['162207'],['0060844094'],['OL7282915M'],['ML421.B4 T87 2005'],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/37921-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/37921-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/37921-L.jpg,The Stories Behind Every Beatles Song,,,['62139503'],,,,['9780060844097'],,,,,,,,,,

Impeccably researched, filled with page-turning romance, passion, and scandal, Sex with the Queen explores the scintillating sexual lives of some of our most beloved and infamous female rulers. She was the queen, living in an opulent palace, wearing lavish gowns and dazzling jewels. She was envied, admired, and revered. She was also miserable, having been forced to marry a foreign prince sight unseen, a royal ogre who was sadistic, foaming at the mouth, physically repulsive, mentally incompetent, or sexually impotent—and in some cases all of the above. How did queens find happiness? In courts bristling with testosterone—swashbuckling generals, polished courtiers, and virile cardinals—many royal women had love affairs. Anne Boleyn flirted with courtiers; Catherine Howard slept with one. Henry VIII had both of them beheaded. Catherine the Great had her idiot husband murdered, and ruled the Russian empire with a long list of sexy young favorites. Marie Antoinette fell in love with the handsome Swedish count Axel Fersen, who tried valiantly to rescue her from the guillotine. Empress Alexandra of Russia found emotional solace in the mad monk Rasputin. Her behavior was the spark that set off the firestorm of the Russian revolution. Princess Diana gave up her palace bodyguard to enjoy countless love affairs, which tragically led to her early death. When a queen became sick to death of her husband and took a lover, anything could happen—from disgrace and death to political victory. Some kings imprisoned erring wives for life; other monarchs obligingly named the queen's lover prime minister. The crucial factor deciding the fate of an unfaithful queen was the love affair's implications in terms of power, money, and factional rivalry. At European courts, it was the politics—not the sex—that caused a royal woman's tragedy—or her ultimate triumph.",2006.0,3.91,336.0,3676.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""As the U.S. population made an unprecedented mad dash for the Sun Belt, one carload of us paddled against the tide, heading for the Promised Land where water falls from the sky and green stuff grows all around. We were about to begin the adventure of realigning our lives with our food chain. ""Naturally, our first stop was to buy junk food and fossil fuel. . . ."" Hang on for the ride: With characteristic poetry and pluck, Barbara Kingsolver and her family sweep readers along on their journey away from the industrial-food pipeline to a rural life in which they vow to buy only food raised in their own neighborhood, grow it themselves, or learn to live without it. Their good-humored search yields surprising discoveries about turkey sex life and overly zealous zucchini plants, en route to a food culture that's better for the neighborhood and also better on the table. Part memoir, part journalistic investigation, Animal, Vegetable, Miracle makes a passionate case for putting the kitchen back at the center of family life and diversified farms at the center of the American diet. ""This is the story of a year in which we made every attempt to feed ourselves animals and vegetables whose provenance we really knew . . . and of how our family was changed by our first year of deliberately eating food produced from the same place where we worked, went to school, loved our neighbors, drank the water, and breathed the air.""",2007.0,4.04,370.0,86130.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meet Zorita, whose sexually explicit ""Consummation of the Wedding of the Snake"" dance (performed with a live snake) and other daring performances earned her legendary status.

Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine.

This also happens with couples--indeed, above all with couples, because lovers fear more than anything else ""losing sight"" of the loved one. With stunning artfulness in expanding and playing variations on the meaningful moment, Milan Kundera has made this situation--and the vague sense of panic it inspires--the very fabric of his new novel. Here brevity goes hand in hand with intensity, and a moment of bewilderment marks the start of a labyrinthine journey during which the reader repeatedly crosses the border between the real and the unreal, between what occurs in the world outside and what the mind creates in its solitude. Of all contemporary writers, only Kundera can transform such a hidden and disconcerting perception into the material for a novel, one of his finest, most painful, and most enlightening.

Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged–and ultimately triumphant–effort to overthrow the Soviet Union. Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan's efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the ""Evil Empire."" The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take––and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency.

Step-by-step, readers follow Jenny's long journey through a ""wasteland"" of failed treatments and therapies, false hope, and abuse by the mental health system that kept her captive most of her life. Although this disease has been at the forefront of public awareness for years, anorexia continues to claim more victims than any other mental illness.

Jenny Hendricks painstakingly recorded her experiences as she suffered from and eventually succumbed to this eating disorder. With candor, she recounts being shipped from one doctor to another and subjected to widely varying treatments--all of which ultimately proved unsuccessful.

Not since the Bombay of Midnight's Children have a time and place been so intensely and accurately captured in a novel. Fury opens on a New York living at breakneck speed in an age of unprecedented decadence. Malik Solanka, historian of ideas and dollmaker extraordinaire, steps out of his life one day, abandons his family without a word of explanation, and flees to New York. There is a fury within him, and he fears that he has become dangerous to those he loves. He arrives in New York at a time of unprecedented plenty, in the highest hour of America's wealth and power, seeking to ""erase"" himself. But fury is all around him. Cab drivers spout invective.

Initially repulsed by the ugliness of her new surroundings in the industrial town of Milton, Margaret becomes aware of the poverty and suffering of the local mill workers and develops a passionate sense of social justice. This is intensified by her tempestuous relationship with the mill-owner and self-made man, John Thornton, as their fierce opposition over his treatment of his employees masks a deeper attraction. In North and South, Elizabeth Gaskell skillfully fused individual feeling with social concern, and in Margaret Hale created one of the most original heroines of Victorian literature.",1996.0,3.93,352.0,264.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Denounced as vulgar by the literary establishment, Three Men in a Boat nevertheless caught the spirit of the times. The expansion of education and the increase in office workers created a new mass readership, and Jerome's book was especially popular among the 'clerking classes' who longed to be 'free from that fretful haste, that vehement striving, that is every day becoming more and more the bane of nineteenth-century life.' So popular did it prove that Jerome reunited his heroes for a bicycle tour of Germany. Despite some sharp, and with hindsight, prophetic observations of the country, Three Men on the Bummel describes an equally picaresque journey constrained only 'by the necessity of getting back within a given time to the point from which one started'.",1999.0,4.09,400.0,2243.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When these relatives become aware of the true value of his art collection, however, their sneering contempt for the parasitic Pons rapidly falls away as they struggle to obtain a piece of the weakening man's inheritance.

What is reality? Could we exist without space and time? Can we travel to the past? What are the limits of the universe? Brian Greene has made the mysteries of space and time accessible to millions with his acclaimed writings and award-winning TV series. Now he reveals a world more beautiful and bizarre than we could have imagined, where 'dark matter' reigns, space warps and wiggles through eleven dimensions, minute particles dance, fizz and teleport across vast distances, everything is made of vibrating strings and, like an ant on a lily-pad, we may be floating on a sliver of spacetime. Revealing new layers of reality that lie just beneath the surface of our everyday lives, this grand tour of the universe will make you look at the world in a completely new way.

It reveals - among other things - how 'President' Bush stole an election aided only by his brother, cousin, his dad's cronies, electoral fraud and tame judges; how the rich stay rich while forcing the rest of us to live in economic fear; and how politicians have whored themselves to big business. Not to mention providing fascinating details on just how stupid Bush is, a convincing case for male obsolescence and a fabulous new use for Whites Only signs! A hilarious must-read for anyone who wants to know what the con is and how 'they' get away with it, Stupid White Men is only available uncensored because public pressure forced the original publishers to publish a book they felt was too hot to handle.

This Penguin Modern Classics edition is edited by Donald A. Yates and James E. Irby, with an introduction by James E. Irby and a preface by André Maurois. Jorge Luis Borges was a literary spellbinder whose tales of magic, mystery and murder are shot through with deep philosophical paradoxes. This collection brings together many of his stories, including the celebrated 'Library of Babel', whose infinite shelves contain every book that could ever exist, 'Funes the Memorious' the tale of a man fated never to forget a single detail of his life, and 'Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote', in which a French poet makes it his life's work to create an identical copy of Don Quixote. In later life, dogged by increasing blindness, Borges used essays and brief tantalising parables to explore the enigma of time, identity and imagination. Playful and disturbing, scholarly and seductive, his is a haunting and utterly distinctive voice. Jorge Luis Borges (1899-1986) was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina. A poet, critic and short story writer, he received numerous awards for his work including the 1961 International Publisher's Prize (shared with Samuel Beckett). He has a reasonable claim, along with Kafka and Joyce, to be one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. If you enjoyed Labyrinths, you might like Franz Kafka's Metamorphosis and Other Stories, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.

S. Eliot ('Wilkie Collins and Dickens') Collins's ability to construct a gripping situation and to create an atmosphere of mystery and menace is fully evident in the three novellas reprinted here. All proceed through a series of dramatic scenes to a climax that in one case at least is literally explosive. The fast-paced Miss or Mrs? (1871) opens on a yacht, features a remarkably unconventional heroine, and entails murder attempts, blackmail, clandestine marriage and commercial fraud. Dramatic and psychologically absorbing, the action of The Haunted Hotel (1878) takes place in an ancient Venetian palazzo converted into a modern hotel that houses a grisly secreI. Lastly, set in a beautiful water-mill, The Guilty River (1886) depicts a group of alienated characters, whose relationships threaten to erupt in violence and murder. Varied in setting and tone, these stories demonstrate Collins's plot-making skill at its most succinct and intricate. *Introduction * Textual Note * Bibliography * Chronology * * Explanatory Notes *Appendix: Collins's prefaces",1999.0,3.79,360.0,170.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In it Walpole attempted, as he declared in the Preface to the second edition, `to blend the two kinds of romance: the ancient and the modern'. He gives us a series of catastrophes, ghostly interventions, revelations of identity, and exciting contests. Crammed with invention, entertainment, terror, and pathos, the novel was an immediate success and Walpole's own favourite among his numerous works. His friend, the poet Thomas Gray, wrote that he and his family, having read Otranto, were now `afraid to go to bed o'nights'. The novel is here reprinted from a text of 1798, the last that Walpole himself prepared for the press.",1998.0,3.18,125.0,15390.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL472215M/The_Castle_of_Otranto,/books/OL472215M,125.0,"xxxviii, 125 p.",Horace Walpole ; edited by W.S.

Set in 1820s imperial Russia, Pushkin's novel in verse follows the emotions and destiny of three men - Onegin the bored fop, Lensky the minor elegiast, and a stylized Pushkin himself - and the fates and affections of three women - Tatyana the provincial beauty, her sister Olga, and Pushkin's mercurial Muse. Engaging, full of suspense, and varied in tone, it also portrays a large cast of other characters and offers the reader many literary, philosophical, and autobiographical digressions, often in a highly satirical vein. Eugene Onegin was Pushkin's own favourite work, and it shows him attempting to transform himself from a romantic poet into a realistic novelist. This new translation seeks to retain both the literal sense and the poetic music of the original, and capture the poem's spontaneity and wit.

It also includes Jane's brother Henry's two biographical accounts. - ;'I doubt whether it would be possible to mention any author of note, whose personal obscurity was so complete.' James Edward Austen-Leigh's Memoir of his aunt Jane Austen was published in 1870, over fifty years after her death. Together with the shorter recollections of James Edward's two sisters, Anna Lefroy and Caroline Austen, the Memoir remains the prime authority for her life and continues to inform all subsequent accounts. These are family memories, the record of Jane Austen's life shaped and limited by the loyalties, reserve, and affection of nieces and nephews recovering in old age the outlines of the young aunt they had each known. They still remembered the shape of her bonnet and the tone of her voice, and their first-hand accounts bring her vividly before us. Their declared partiality also raises fascinating issues concerning biographical truth, and the terms in which all biography functions. This edition brings together for the first time these three memoirs, and also includes Jane's brother Henry Austen's 'Biographical Notice' of 1818 and his lesser known 'Memoir' of 1833, making a unique biographical record. -",2002.0,3.83,352.0,880.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do great works of the imagination originate in words or in images? Is there a rational explanation for the sudden appearance of geniuses like Mozart or Einstein? Such questions have fascinated people for centuries; only in recent years, however, has cognitive psychology been able to provide some clues to the mysterious process of creativity. In this revised edition of Notebooks of the Mind, Vera John-Steiner combines imaginative insight with scientific precision to produce a startling account of the human mind working at its highest potential. To approach her subject John-Steiner goes directly to the source, assembling the thoughts of ""experienced thinkers""--artists, philosophers, writers, and scientists able to reflect on their own imaginative patterns. More than fifty interviews (with figures ranging from Jessica Mitford to Aaron Copland), along with excerpts from the diaries, letters, and autobiographies of such gifted giants as Leo Tolstoy, Marie Curie, and Diego Rivera, among others, provide illuminating insights into creative activity. We read, for example, of Darwin's preoccupation with the image of nature as a branched tree while working on his concept of evolution. Mozart testifies to the vital influence on his mature art of the wondrous ""bag of memories"" he retained from childhood. Anais Nin describes her sense of words as oppressive, explaining how imagistic free association freed her as a writer. Adding these personal accounts to laboratory studies of thought process, John-Steiner takes a refreshingly holistic approach to the question of creativity. What emerges is an intriguing demonstration of how specific sociocultural circumstances interact with certain personality traits to encourage the creative mind. Among the topics examined here are the importance of childhood mentor figures; the lengthy apprenticeship of the talented person; and the development of self- expression through highly individualistic languages, whether in images, movement or inner speech. Now, with a new introduction, this award-winning book provides an uniquely broad-based study of the origins, development and fruits of human inspiration.",1997.0,3.81,288.0,17.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7387996M/Notebooks_of_the_Mind,/books/OL7387996M,288.0,,,"Oxford University Press, USA",,"December 5, 1996","[{'name': 'Creative thinking', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/creative_thinking'}, {'name': 'Creation (Literary, artistic, etc.)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/creation_(literary,_artistic,_etc.)'}, {'name': 'Elocution', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/elocution'}, {'name': 'Readers and speakers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/readers_and_speakers'}, {'name': 'Thought and thinking', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/thought_and_thinking'}, {'name': 'Logic', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/logic'}, {'name': 'Creation (literary, artistic, etc.)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/creation_(literary,_artistic,_etc.)'}]",,,['29990'],['1128739'],['0195108965'],['OL7387996M'],"['BF408.J5 1997', 'BF408 .J5 1997']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/123511-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/123511-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/123511-L.jpg,Explorations of Thinking,,['96031307'],['35033695'],,,Movement is a basic human experience.,['9780195108965'],,,,,,,,,,

Insisting on the centrality of women as historical actors and gender as a category of analysis, this work shows how the fateful political choices made by the low-country yeomanry were rooted in the politics of the household, particularly in the customary relations of power male heads of independent households assumed over their dependents, whether slaves or free women and children. Such masterly prerogatives, practiced in the domestic sphere and redeemed in the public, explain the yeomanry's deep commitment to slavery and, ultimately, their ardent embrace of secession.By placing the yeomanry in the center of the drama, McCurry offers a significant reinterpretation of this volatile society on the road to Civil War.

But in this sweeping overview of the rise of civilization, Robert O'Connell finds that war is indeed an invention--an institution that arosedue to very specific historical circumstances, an institution that now verges on extinction. In Ride of the Second Horseman, O'Connell probes the distant human past to show how and why war arose. He begins with a definition that distinguishes between war and mere feuding: war involves group rather than individual issues, political or economic goals, and direction by some governmentalstructure, carried out with the intention of lasting results. With this definition, he finds that ants are the only other creatures that conduct it--battling other colonies for territory and slaves. But ants, unlike humans, are driven by their genes; in humans, changes in our culture and subsistencepatterns, not our genetic hardware, brought the rise of organized warfare. O'Connell draws on anthropology and archeology to locate the rise of war sometime after the human transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to agriculture, when society split between farmers and pastoralists. Around 5500BC, these pastoralists initiated the birth of war with raids on Middle Eastern agricultural settlements. The farmers responded by ringing their villages with walls, setting off a process of further social development, intensified combat, and ultimately the rise of complex urban societies dependentupon warfare to help stabilize what amounted to highly volatile population structures, beset by frequent bouts of famine and epidemic disease. In times of overpopulation, the armies either conquered new lands or self-destructed, leaving fewer mouths to feed. In times of underpopulation, slaves weretaken to provide labor. O'Connell explores the histories of the civilizations of ancient Sumeria, Egypt, Assyria, China, and the New World, showing how war came to each and how it adapted to varying circumstances. On the other hand, societies based on trade employed war much more selectively andpragmatically. Thus, Minoan Crete, long protected from marauding pastoralists, developed a wealthy mercantile society marked by unmilitaristic attitudes, equality between men and women, and a relative absence of class distinctions. In Assyria, by contrast, war came to be an end in itself, in aculture dominated by male warriors. Despite the violence in the world today, O'Connell finds reason for hope. The industrial revolution broke the old patterns of subsistence: war no longer serves the demographic purpose it once did.

They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That's why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter-to-mother, to 'Mitochondrial Eve'. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that's not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy-generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought-provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don't we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death.

This introduction to the period traces the process by which Christianitychanged this and so provided a foundation for the modern world: the teaching of Jesus created a lasting community, which grew to command the allegiance of the Roman emperor. Christianity is discussed in relation to how it appeared to both Jews and pagans, and how its Christian doctrine and practicewere shaped in relation to Graeco-Roman culture and the Jewish matrix. Among the major figures discussed are Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Constantine, Julian the Apostate, Basil, Ambrose, and Augustine.Following a chronological approach, Henry Chadwick's clear exposition of important texts and theological debates in their historical context is unrivalled in detail. In particular, theological and ecclesial texts are examined in relation to the behaviour and beliefs of people who attended churchesand synagogues. Christians did not find agreement and unity easy and the author displays a distinctive concern for the factors - theological, personal, and political - which caused division in the church and prevented reconciliation.

Feynman (1918–1988) was widely recognized as the most creative physicist of the post–World War II period. His career was extraordinarily expansive. From his contributions to the development of the atomic bomb a Los Alamos during World War II to his work in quantum electrodynamics, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1965, Feynman was celebrated for his brilliant and irreverent approach to physics.It was Feynman's outrageous and scintillating method of teaching that earned him legendary status among students and professors of physics. From 1961–1963, Feynman, at the California Institute of Technology, delivered a series of lectures that revolutionized the teaching of physics around the world. Six Easy Pieces, taken from the famous Lectures on Physics, represents the most accessible material from this series. In these six chapters, Feynman introduces the general reader to the following topics: atoms, basic physics, the relationship of physics to other topics, energy, gravitation, and quantum force. With his dazzling and inimitable wit, Feynman presents each discussion without equations or technical jargon.Readers will remember how—using ice water and rubber—Feynman demonstrated with stunning simplicity to a nationally televised audience the physics of the 1986 Challenger disaster.

He soon finds himself enchanted by his host's daughter, the lovely and inscrutable Maitreyi, a precocious young poet and former student of Tagore. What follows is a charming, tentative flirtation that soon, against all the proprieties and precepts of Indian society, blossoms into a love affair both impossible and ultimately tragic. This erotic passion plays itself out in Alain's thoughts long after its bitter conclusion. In hindsight he sets down the story, quoting from the diaries of his disordered days, and trying to make sense of the sad affair. A vibrantly poetic love story, Bengal Nights is also a cruel account of the wreckage left in the wake of a young man's self discovery. At once horrifying and deeply moving, Eliade's story repeats the patterns of European engagement with India even as it exposes and condemns them. Invaluable for the insight it offers into Eliade's life and thought, it is a work of great intellectual and emotional power. ""Bengal Nights is forceful and harshly poignant, written with a great love of India informed by clear-eyed understanding. But do not open it if you prefer to remain unmoved by your reading matter. It is enough to make stones weep."" — Literary Review Mircea Eliade (1907-1986) was the Sewell L. Avery Distinguished Service Professor in the Divinity School and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago. Many of his scholarly works, as well as his two-volume autobiography and four-volume journal, are published by the University of Chicago Press. Translated into French in 1950, Bengal Nights was an immediate critical success.

He was a writer of some distinction—a prolific novelist and a keen literary critic. He was also a dedicated anti-Semite, an acerbic opponent of French democracy, and editor in chief of the fascist weekly Je Suis Partout, in whose pages he regularly printed wartime denunciations of Jews and resistance activists. Was Brasillach in fact guilty of treason? Was he condemned for his denunciations of the resistance, or singled out as a suspected homosexual? Was it right that he was executed when others, who were directly responsible for the murder of thousands, were set free? Kaplan's meticulous reconstruction of Brasillach's life and trial skirts none of these ethical subtleties: a detective story, a cautionary tale, and a meditation on the disturbing workings of justice and memory, The Collaborator will stand as the definitive account of Brasillach's crime and punishment.

That Sartre's study of Flaubert, The Family Idiot, is a towering achievement in intellectual history has never been disputed. Yet critics have argued about the precise nature of this novel or biography or ""criticism-fiction"" which is the summation of Sartre's philosophical, social, and literary thought. In the preface, Sartre writes: ""The Family Idiot is the sequel to Search for a Method. The subject: what, at this point in time, can we know about a man? It seemed to me that this question could only be answered by studying a specific case."" Sartre discusses Flaubert's personal development, his relationship to his family, his decision to become a writer, and the psychosomatic crisis or ""conversion"" from his father's domination to the freedom of his art. Sartre blends psychoanalysis with a sociological study of the ideology of the period, the crisis in literature, and Flaubert's influence on the future of literature. While Sartre never wrote the final volume he envisioned for this vast project, the existing volumes constitute in themselves a unified work—one that John Sturrock, writing in the Observer, called ""a shatteringly fertile, digressive and ruthless interpretation of these few cardinal years in Flaubert's life."" ""A virtuoso perfomance. . . . For all that this book does to make one reconsider his life, The Family Idiot is less a case study of Flaubert than it is a final installment of Sartre's mythology. . . . The translator, Carol Cosman, has acquitted herself brilliantly.""—Frederick Brown, New York Review of Books ""A splendid translation by Carol Cosman. . . . Sartre called The Family Idiot a 'true novel,' and it does tell a story and eventually reach a shattering climax. The work can be described most simply as a dialectic, which shifts between two seemingly alternative interpretations of Flaubert's destiny: a psychoanalytic one, centered on his family and on his childhood, and a Marxist one, whose guiding themes are the status of the artist in Flaubert's period and the historical and ideological contradictions faced by his social class, the bourgeoisie.""—Fredric Jameson, New York Times Book Review Jean-Paul Sartre (1906-1980) was offered, but declined, the Nobel Prize for literature in 1964.

Bleak tools of the cold war, they embodied the rigid organization and mechanical conformity that made the military-industrial complex possible. But by the 1990s—and the dawn of the Internet—computers started to represent a very different kind of world: a collaborative and digital utopia modeled on the communal ideals of the hippies who so vehemently rebelled against the cold war establishment in the first place. From Counterculture to Cyberculture is the first book to explore this extraordinary and ironic transformation. Fred Turner here traces the previously untold story of a highly influential group of San Francisco Bay–area entrepreneurs: Stewart Brand and the Whole Earth network. Between 1968 and 1998, via such familiar venues as the National Book Award–winning Whole Earth Catalog, the computer conferencing system known as WELL, and, ultimately, the launch of the wildly successful Wired magazine, Brand and his colleagues brokered a long-running collaboration between San Francisco flower power and the emerging technological hub of Silicon Valley. Thanks to their vision, counterculturalists and technologists alike joined together to reimagine computers as tools for personal liberation, the building of virtual and decidedly alternative communities, and the exploration of bold new social frontiers. Shedding new light on how our networked culture came to be, this fascinating book reminds us that the distance between the Grateful Dead and Google, between Ken Kesey and the computer itself, is not as great as we might think.",2006.0,3.96,327.0,323.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Including women married and single, young and old, lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual, the anthology covers historical development and changing mores through the seventeenth century, after the Restoration of Charles II, a time of relative freedom for women; the eighteenth century, when the cult of romantic friendship reached its peak; the nineteenth century, when women writers wrote about issues of same-sex desire indirectly and explored complex issues such as death in tones of weariness and resignation; and the twentieth century, when poets began to engage in more overt explorations of women's bodies, sensuality, and lovemaking. Emma Donoghue's introduction deftly guides readers into the rich tradition of women's poetry in English, exploring the relationships between poets and their muses and poets and their cultures.

Neither extolling nor condemning drug use, it is a story of scientific and artistic achievement, war and greed, empires and religions, and lessons for the future. Ciaran Regan looks at each class of drugs, describing the historical evolution of their use, explaining how they work within the brain's neurophysiology, and outlining the basic pharmacology of those substances. From a consideration of the effect of stimulants, such as caffeine and nicotine, and the reasons and consequences of their sudden popularity in the seventeenth century, the book moves to a discussion of more modern stimulants, such as cocaine and ecstasy. In addition, Regan explains how we process memory, the nature of thought disorders, and therapies for treating depression and schizophrenia. Regan then considers psychedelic drugs and their perceived mystical properties and traces the history of placebos to ancient civilizations.

Although these women are part of a modernizing middle class, they also voluntarily adopt a traditional symbol of female subordination. How can this paradox be explained? An explanation emerges which reconceptualizes what appears to be reactionary behavior as a new style of political struggle--as accommodating protest. These women, most of them clerical workers in the large government bureaucracy, are ambivalent about working outside the home, considering it a change which brings new burdens as well as some important benefits. At the same time they realize that leaving home and family is creating an intolerable situation of the erosion of their social status and the loss of their traditional identity. The new veiling expresses women's protest against this. MacLeod argues that the symbolism of the new veiling emerges from this tense subcultural dilemma, involving elements of both resistance and acquiescence.",1999.0,3.96,192.0,4.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6780416M/William_Faulkner,/books/OL6780416M,208.0,208 p. ;,edited by Nicolas Tredell.,Columbia University Press,New York,1999,"[{'name': 'Modernism (Literature)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/modernism_(literature)'}, {'name': 'In literature', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/in_literature'}, {'name': 'Criticism and interpretation', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/criticism_and_interpretation'}, {'name': 'Faulkner, william, 1897-1962', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/faulkner,_william,_1897-1962'}, {'name': 'Modernism (literature)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/modernism_(literature)'}]","[{'name': 'United States', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:united_states'}, {'name': 'Mississippi', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:mississippi'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4', 'availability': 'full', 'formats': {'pdf': {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4.pdf'}, 'epub': {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4.epub'}, 'text': {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4_djvu.txt'}}, 'read_url': 'https://archive.org/stream/williamfaulkners0000unse_m6g4'}]","['761341', '31356']",['104981'],"['0231121881', '023112189X']",['OL6780416M'],"['PS3511.A86 S86 1999', 'PS3511.A86S86 1999']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5001699-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5001699-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/5001699-L.jpg,The sound and the fury ; As I lay dying,Includes bibliographical references and index.,['00026251'],,['813/.52'],William Faulkner (1897-1962),,,,,,,,,,,,

The Vita Nuova (the New Life) is a small book which relates in prose and often very beautiful verse the story of the youthful Dante's love for Beatrice. The esay which follows the translation provides new insights into this puzzling thirteenth-century work. Musa regards Dante's intention in this so-called ""Book of Memory"" as a cruel and comic commentary on the youthful lover. He argues that Dante, using the tradition of love poetry current in his time, points up the foolishness and shallowness of his protagonist, a self-centered and self-pitying youth who only occasionally in the progress of his suffering catches even a glimpse of the true nature of Love or his beloved. ""The sensitive man who would realize a man's destiny must ruthlessly cut out of his heart the canker at its center [i.e. self-pity], the canker that the heart instinctively tends to cultivate."" According to Musa, this is one of Dante's central ideas.

He approaches Lacan through the motifs andworks of contemporary popular culture, from Hitchcock's Vertigo to Stephen King's Pet Sematary, fromMcCullough's An Indecent Obsession to Romero's Return of the Living Dead - a strategy of ""lookingawry"" that recalls the exhilarating and vital experience of Lacan.Zizek discovers fundamentalLacanian categories the triad Imaginary/Symbolic/Real, the object small a, the opposition of driveand desire, the split subject - at work in horror fiction, in detective thrillers, in romances, inthe mass media's perception of ecological crisis, and, above all, in Alfred Hitchcock's films. Theplayfulness of Zizek's text, however, is entirely different from that associated with thedeconstructive approach made famous by Derrida. By clarifying what Lacan is saying as well as whathe is not saying, Zizek is uniquely able to distinguish Lacan from the poststructuralists who sooften claim him.Slavoj Zizek is a Researcher in the Institute of Sociology at the University ofLjubljana, Yugoslavia.

In The Puppet and the Dwarf he offers a close reading of today's religious constellation from the viewpoint of Lacanian psychoanalysis. He critically confronts both predominant versions of today's spirituality--New Age gnosticism and deconstructionist-Levinasian Judaism--and then tries to redeem the ""materialist"" kernel of Christianity. His reading of Christianity is explicitly political, discerning in the Pauline community of believers the first version of a revolutionary collective. Since today even advocates of Enlightenment like Jurgen Habermas acknowledge that a religious vision is needed to ground our ethical and political stance in a ""postsecular"" age, this book--with a stance that is clearly materialist and at the same time indebted to the core of the Christian legacy--is certain to stir controversy.",2003.0,3.83,196.0,617.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today it's a timebomb ticking in the heart of astrophysics. For zero, infinity's twin, is not like other numbers. It is both nothing and everything.Zero has pitted East against West and faith against reason, and its intransigence persists in the dark core of a black hole and the brilliant flash of the Big Bang. Today, zero lies at the heart of one of the biggest scientific controversies of all time: the quest for a theory of everything. Within the concept of zero lies a philosophical and scientific history of humanity.Charles Seife's elegant and witty account takes us from Aristotle to superstring theory by way of Egyptian geometry, Kabbalism, Einstein, the Chandrasekhar limit and Stephen Hawking.

As a result of his famous ”double pincer” maneuver, 70,000 Roman soldiers died within the space of a few hours on a field the size of New York's Central Park. Yet, as devastating and startling as Cannae was, it was only one of a long list of incredible achievements. Hannibal's fantastic 1,000-mile march across the Alps from Spain to Italy was one of the wonders of ancient times. He began his hazardous journey with 90,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, and 37 elephants. By the time he reached the Valley of the Po, more than 30,000 troops and many of his elephants had perished, but he still managed to stay in Italy for sixteen years.Blending biography and military adventure, Hannibal is a portrait of a military genius who was also a highly civilized man. The son of Hamilcar Barca, a famous general in his own right, Hannibal was a student of the Greek classics. But his father's lifelong grudge against Rome fostered in the son a deep hatred for that Republic and a fierce determination to subdue it forever. This resulted in the bloody battles of Lake Trasimene, Campania, Nole, Capua, and Zama, all of which Leonard Cottrell describes with vigor and authority. In gathering material for Hannibal, Cottrell traveled the entire route that Hannibal took across the Alps, thus bringing to his account a valuable firsthand knowledge of his subject.

Shirer stood in the streets of Paris and watched the unending flow of gray German uniforms along its boulevards. In just six lovely weeks in the spring and summer of 1940 a single battle brought down in total military defeat one of the world's oldest, greatest, and most civilized powers—the second mightiest empire on earth and the possessor of one of the finest military machines ever assembled. How did it happen? After nearly a decade of research in the massive archives left from World War II and after hundreds of conversations with the Third Republic’s leaders, generals, diplomats, and ordinary citizens, Shirer presents the definitive answer in his stunning re-creation of why and how France fell before Hitler's armies in 1940. His book is also a devastating examination of the confusion, corruption, and cynicism that drained the strength and toughness of a democracy which Thomas Jefferson once called ""every man's second country."" This book complements and completes the dramatic story of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich and continues to rank as one of the most important works of history of our time.",1994.0,4.2,1082.0,497.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This remarkable debut book chronicles what has happened in Rwanda and neighboring states since 1994, when the Rwandan government called on everyone in the Hutu majority to murder everyone in the Tutsi minority. Though the killing was low-tech--largely by machete--it was carried out at shocking speed: some 800,000 people were exterminated in a hundred days. A Tutsi pastor, in a letter to his church president, a Hutu, used the chilling phrase that gives Philip Gourevitch his title. With keen dramatic intensity, Gourevitch frames the genesis and horror of Rwanda's ""genocidal logic"" in the anguish of its aftermath: the mass displacements, the temptations of revenge and the quest for justice, the impossibly crowded prisons and refugee camps. Through intimate portraits of Rwandans in all walks of life, he focuses on the psychological and political challenges of survival and on how the new leaders of postcolonial Africa went to war in the Congo when resurgent genocidal forces threatened to overrun central Africa. Can a country composed largely of perpetrators and victims create a cohesive national society? This moving contribution to the literature of witness tells us much about the struggle everywhere to forge sane, habitable political orders, and about the stubbornness of the human spirit in a world of extremity.

In this oral memoir, Williams identifies the essential elements of sound education and describes the battles she waged to secure those elements, first as teacher, then a counselor, and, for twenty-five years, as principal. She also described her own education - growing up black in largely white Germantown, Pennsylvania; studying black history and culture for the first time at Cheyney State Teachers College; and meeting the rigorous demands of the program which she graduated from in 1949. In retracing her career, Williams examines the highs and lows of urban public education since World War II.

9780312300333,0312300336,Banvard's Folly,Thirteen Tales of People Who Didn't Change the World,Paul Collins,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MSv6w5Ba2Y4C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"The historical record crowns success. Those enshrined in its annals are men and women whose ideas, accomplishments, or personalities have dominated, endured, and most important of all, found champions. John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage, Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Artists, and Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets are classic celebrations of the greatest, the brightest, the eternally constellated. Paul Collins' Banvard's Folly is a different kind of book. Here are thirteen unforgettable portraits of forgotten people: men and women who might have claimed their share of renown but who, whether from ill timing, skullduggery, monomania, the tinge of madness, or plain bad luck-or perhaps some combination of them all-leapt straight from life into thankless obscurity. Among their number are scientists, artists, writers, entrepreneurs, and adventurers, from across the centuries and around the world. They hold in common the silenced aftermath of failure, the name that rings no bells. Collins brings them back to glorious life. John Banvard was an artist whose colossal panoramic canvasses (one behemoth depiction of the entire eastern shore of the Mississippi River was simply known as ""The Three Mile Painting"") made him the richest and most famous artist of his day. . . before he decided to go head to head with P. T. Barnum. René Blondot was a distinguished French physicist whose celebrated discovery of a new form of radiation, called the N-Ray, went terribly awry. At the tender age of seventeen, William Henry Ireland signed ""William Shakespeare"" to a book and launched a short but meteoric career as a forger of undiscovered works by the Bard -- until he pushed his luck too far. John Symmes, a hero of the War of 1812, nearly succeeded in convincing Congress to fund an expedition to the North Pole, where he intended to prove his theory that the earth was hollow and ripe for exploitation; his quixotic quest counted Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe among its greatest admirers. Collins' love for what he calls the ""forgotten ephemera of genius"" give his portraits of these figures and the other nine men and women in Banvard's Folly sympathetic depth and poignant relevance. Their effect is not to make us sneer or revel in schadenfreude; here are no cautionary tales. Rather, here are brief introductions-acts of excavation and reclamation-to people whom history may have forgotten, but whom now we cannot.",2002.0,3.97,320.0,498.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9780312300531,0312300530,The Last Jew,A Novel of The Spanish Inquisition,Noah Gordon,Fiction,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=rUydl6GzWSUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"In the year 1492, the Inquisition has all of Spain in its grip. After centuries of pogrom-like riots encouraged by the Church, the Jews - who have been an important part of Spanish life since the days of the Romans - are expelled from the country by royal edict. Many who wish to remain are intimidated by Church and Crown and become Catholics, but several hundred thousand choose to retain their religion and depart; given little time to flee, some perish even before they can escape from Spain. Yonah Toledano, the 15-year-old son of a celebrated Spanish silversmith, has seen his father and brother die during these terrible days - victims whose murders go almost unnoticed in a time of mass upheaval. Trapped in Spain by circumstances, he is determined to honor the memory of his family by remaining a Jew. On a donkey named Moise, Yonah begins a meandering journey, a young fugitive zigzagging across the vastness of Spain. Toiling at manual labor, he desperately tries to cling to his memories of a vanished culture. As a lonely shepherd on a mountaintop he hurls snatches of almost forgotten Hebrew at the stars, as an apprentice armorer he learns to fight like a Christian knight. Finally, as a man living in a time and land where danger from the Inquisition is everywhere, he deals with the questions that mark his past. How he discovers the answers, how he finds his way to a singular and strong Marrano woman, how he achieves a life with the outer persona of a respected Old Christian physician and the inner life of a secret Jew, is the fabric of this novel. The Last Jew is a glimpse of the past, an authentic tale of high adventure, and a tender and unforgettable love story. In it, Noah Gordon utilizes his greatest strengths, and the result is remarkable and moving.",1992.0,4.08,352.0,4119.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL9882402M/The_Last_Jew,/books/OL9882402M,352.0,,,St. Martin's Griffin,,"May 14, 2002","[{'name': 'Inquisition', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/inquisition'}, {'name': 'Jews', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/jews'}, {'name': 'Persecutions', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/persecutions'}, {'name': 'Healers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/healers'}, {'name': 'Fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction'}, {'name': 'Historical fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/historical_fiction'}, {'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'Fiction, general', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_general'}, {'name': 'Judíos', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/judíos'}, {'name': 'Historia', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/historia'}, {'name': 'Curanderos (Medicina folklórica)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/curanderos_(medicina_folklórica)'}, {'name': 'Inquisición', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/inquisición'}, {'name': 'Ficción', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/ficción'}, {'name': 'French fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/french_fiction'}, {'name': 'Roman historique', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/roman_historique'}, {'name': 'Romans, nouvelles', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/romans,_nouvelles'}, {'name': 'Juifs', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/juifs'}, {'name': 'Histoire', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/histoire'}]","[{'name': 'Spain', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:spain'}, {'name': 'España', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:españa'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/lastjew00noah', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL9882402M/The_Last_Jew/borrow', 'checkedout': True}]",['4696'],['189049'],['0312300530'],['OL9882402M'],[''],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/178820-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/178820-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/178820-L.jpg,,,,['49644586'],,,The bad time began for Bernardo Espina on a day when the air hung heavy as iron and the arrogant sunshine was a curse.,['9780312300531'],"[{'name': 'Ferdinand and Isabella, 1479-1516', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/time:ferdinand_and_isabella,_1479-1516'}, {'name': 'Fernando e Isabel, 1479-1516', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/time:fernando_e_isabel,_1479-1516'}]",,,,,,10.9 ounces,,,

Frey,Language Arts & Disciplines,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X47rmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"Edgar award nominee James N. Frey, author of the internationally best-selling books on the craft of writing, How to Write a Damn Good Novel, How to Write a Damn Good Novel II: Advanced Techniques, and The Key: How to Write Damn Good Fiction Using the Power of Myth, has now written what is certain to become the standard ""how to"" book for mystery writing, How to Write a Damn Good Mystery. Frey urges writers to aim high-not to try to write a good-enough-to-get-published mystery, but a damn good mystery. A damn good mystery is first a dramatic novel, Frey insists-a dramatic novel with living, breathing characters-and he shows his readers how to create a living, breathing, believable character who will be clever and resourceful, willful and resolute, and will be what Frey calls ""the author of the plot behind the plot."" Frey then shows, in his well-known, entertaining, and accessible (and often humorous) style , how the characters-the entire ensemble, including the murderer, the detective, the authorities, the victims, the suspects, the witnesses and the bystanders-create a complete and coherent world. Exploring both the on-stage action and the behind-the-scenes intrigue, Frey shows prospective writers how to build a fleshed-out, believable, and logical world. He shows them exactly which parts of that world show up in the pages of a damn good mystery-and which parts are held back just long enough to keep the reader guessing. This is an indispensable step-by-step guide for anyone who's ever dreamed of writing a damn good mystery.",2004.0,3.97,288.0,305.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through her art she sought to encourage conservation and change the world.

The winner of a Hugo, a Nebula, and a World Fantasy Award, Vance lays claim to a career that spans more than five decades of critical acclaim and devoted readership. Tor Books has recognized his widespread audience and for years has brought classic Jack Vance novels back into print--most recently The Demon Princes, Volume One, and omnibus containing the first three books of Vance's beloved Demon Princes series. Tor now presents The Demon Princes, Volume Two, and omnibus containing the series' final two novels, The Face and The Book of Dreams. Kirth Gersen carries in his pocket a slip of paper with a list of five names written upon it--the names of five Demon Princes. The Demon Princes are a race of beings who disguise themselves as humans and delight in power and destruction. however, to Kirth they are merely murderers who killed his family and destroyed his home planet--and who deserves to die for those misdeeds. Three have already fallen in Kirth's hands, but there are two more names on his list, two more Princes who will live only long enough to regret their evil ways. Lens Larque was just as unique as the other Demon Princes--uniquely appalling. He was personally ugly, startling vicious, and arrogant above all others. Larque's own mission was a villainy of the highest order, and his personal obsession with success kept him hidden well from attackers--almost well enough. Howard Alan Treesong poisoned his friends, tortured his colleagues, and wrote his own horrific holy book, The Book of Dreams. But, clever as he may be, a galaxy-wide guessing game will be his undoing--and Kirth Gersen's sworn vengeance will be complete.",1997.0,4.3,397.0,641.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now Thomas and Saxony have come to France's hometown, the dreamy Midwestern town of Galen, Missouri, to write France's biography. Warned in advance that France's family may oppose them, they're surprised to find France's daughter warmly welcoming instead.

That tradition culminated in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897), which fixed the character of the Transylvanian nobleman firmly in the public imagination. The contributors to this volume examine representations of the vampire in fiction, film, folklore, and popular culture. While some look at Stoker and the early literary vampire, others study the works of contemporary writers, such as Anne Rice and Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, vampirism as a metaphor for AIDS, and racial issues in such films as Blacula and Vampire in Brooklyn.",2002.0,0.0,176.0,0.0,Low Rating,33.44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths.

The Black Echo (Winner of the Edgar Award for Best First Novel) For Harry Bosch-hero, loner, nighthawk-the body stuffed in a drainpipe off Mulholland Drive isn't just another statistic. This one is personal. Billy Meadows was a fellow Vietnam ""tunnel rat,"" fighting the VC and the fear they used to call the Black Echo. Harry let Meadows down once. He won't do it again. The Black Ice The corpse in the hotel room seems to be that of a missing LAPD narcotics officer. Rumors abound that the cop had crossed over-selling a new drug called Black Ice. Now Harry's making some dangerous connections, leading from the cop to a string of bloody murders, and from Hollywood Boulevard's drug bazaar to Mexico's dusty back alleys. In this lethal game, Harry is likely to be the next victim. The Concrete Blonde When Harry Bosch shot and killed Norman Church, the police were convinced it marked the end of the hunt for the Dollmaker-L.A.'s most bizarre serial killer. But now Church's widow is accusing Harry of killing the wrong man-a charge that rings terrifyingly true when a new victim is discovered with the Dollmaker's macabre signature. For the second time, Harry must hunt the murderer down, before he strikes again. Together, these three novels are the perfect way to discover, or rediscover, the sleuth the New York Times Book Review called a ""wonderful, old-fashioned hero who isn't afraid to walk through the flames.""",2001.0,4.34,794.0,1966.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his breakthrough bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. Now, in Blink, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within. Blink is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others? In Blink we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. Blink reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.",2005.0,3.92,277.0,4089.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23273215M/Blink,/books/OL23273215M,277.0,"viii, 277 p. :",Malcolm Gladwell.,"Little, Brown and Co.",New York,2005,"[{'name': 'Intuition', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/intuition'}, {'name': 'Education', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/education'}, {'name': 'Recovery', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/recovery'}, {'name': 'Business', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/business'}, {'name': 'Intuïtie', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/intuïtie'}, {'name': 'Prise de décision (Psychologie)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/prise_de_décision_(psychologie)'}, {'name': 'Open Library Staff Picks', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/open_library_staff_picks'}, {'name': 'Besluitvorming', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/besluitvorming'}, {'name': 'Jugement (Logique)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/jugement_(logique)'}, {'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'New York Times bestseller', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/new_york_times_bestseller'}, {'name': 'Pensée', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/pensée'}, {'name': 'nyt:paperback_nonfiction=2008-05-17', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/nyt:paperback_nonfiction=2008-05-17'}, {'name': 'Nonfiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/nonfiction'}, {'name': 'Popular Works', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/popular_works'}, {'name': 'Decision making', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/decision_making'}, {'name': 'Psychology', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/psychology'}, {'name': 'Intuición', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/intuición'}, {'name': 'Decisiones, Teoría de las', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/decisiones,_teoría_de_las'}, {'name': 'Large type books', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/large_type_books'}, {'name': 'Prise de décision', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/prise_de_décision'}, {'name': 'Prise de décision (Relations humaines)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/prise_de_décision_(relations_humaines)'}, {'name': 'Toma de decisiones', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/toma_de_decisiones'}, {'name': 'Développement personnel', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/développement_personnel'}, {'name': 'Sciences cognitives', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/sciences_cognitives'}, {'name': 'Relations humaines', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/relations_humaines'}, {'name': 'Aspects psychologiques', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/aspects_psychologiques'}, {'name': 'Decision Making', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/decision_making'}, {'name': 'SELF-HELP', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/self-help'}, {'name': 'Cognitive Psychology & Cognition', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/cognitive_psychology_&_cognition'}, {'name': 'LEADERSHIP', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/leadership'}, {'name': 'Social Psychology', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/social_psychology'}, {'name': 'Personal Growth', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/personal_growth'}, {'name': 'PSYCHOLOGY', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/psychology'}, {'name': 'General', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/general'}, {'name': 'Ponderación y decisión', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/ponderación_y_decisión'}, {'name': 'Intuicíon', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/intuicíon'}, {'name': 'New York Times reviewed', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/new_york_times_reviewed'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/blinkpowerofthin00glad', 'availability': 'full', 'formats': {'pdf': {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/blinkpowerofthin00glad/blinkpowerofthin00glad.pdf'}, 'epub': {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/blinkpowerofthin00glad/blinkpowerofthin00glad.epub'}, 'text': {'url': 'https://archive.org/download/blinkpowerofthin00glad/blinkpowerofthin00glad_djvu.txt'}}, 'read_url': 'https://archive.org/stream/blinkpowerofthin00glad'}]",['2140'],['1976'],['0316172324'],['OL23273215M'],"['BF448 .G53 2005', 'BF448.G53 2005']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6383854-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6383854-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6383854-L.jpg,the power of thinking without thinking,Includes bibliographical references (p.

Were residential buildings flush with the street? What was anyone likely to see along the River Seine? By answering such questions, Trout constructs a social history of the city that is unequalled.

9780345438713,034543871X,The Collapse of the Common Good,How America's Lawsuit Culture Undermines Our Freedom,Philip K. Howard,Political Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v1Upp5P_VrAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"In pursuit of fairness at any cost, we have created a society paralyzed by legal fear: Doctors are paranoid and principals powerless. Little league coaches, scared of liability, stop volunteering. Schools and hospitals start to crumble. The common good fades, replaced by a cacophony of people claiming their “individual rights.” By turns funny and infuriating, this startling book dissects the dogmas of fairness that allow self-interested individuals to bully the rest of society. Philip K. Howard explains how, trying to honor individual rights, we removed the authority needed to maintain a free society. Teachers don’t even have authority to maintain order in the classroom. With no one in charge, the safe course is to avoid any possible risk. Seesaws and diving boards are removed. Ridiculous warning labels litter the American landscape: “Caution: Contents Are Hot.” Striving to protect “individual rights,” we ended up losing much of our freedom. When almost any decision that someone disagrees with is a possible lawsuit, no one knows where he stands. A huge monument to the unknown plaintiff looms high above America, casting a dark shadow across our daily choices. Today, in the land of free speech, you’d have to be a fool to say what you really think. This provocative book not only attacks the sacred cows of political correctness, but takes a breathtakingly bold stand on how to reinvigorate our common good. Only by restoring personal authority can schools begin to work again. Only by judges and legislatures taking back the authority to decide who can sue for what can doctors feel comfortable using their best judgment and American be liberated to say and do what they know is right. Lucid, honest, and hard hitting, The Collapse of the Common Good shows how Americans can bring back freedom and common sense to a society disabled by lawyers and legal fear.",2002.0,3.92,272.0,58.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL9752934M/The_Collapse_of_the_Common_Good,/books/OL9752934M,272.0,,,Ballantine Books,,"January 29, 2002","[{'name': 'Anthropology - Cultural', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/anthropology_-_cultural'}, {'name': 'Bureaucracy', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/bureaucracy'}, {'name': 'Law', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/law'}, {'name': 'Law reform', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/law_reform'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/collapseofcommon00phil', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL9752934M/The_Collapse_of_the_Common_Good/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['481'],['326022'],['034543871X'],['OL9752934M'],,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/209903-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/209903-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/209903-L.jpg,How America's Lawsuit Culture Undermines Our Freedom,,,,,,"""The double slide in Oologah, Oklahoma, donated to the town park by the Kiwanis Club, was a local landmark.""",['9780345438713'],,,,,,,8.8 ounces,,,

Paris and Antwerp have recently emerged as important new centers of Jewish culture. Small but proud Jewish communities are revitalizing the ancient centers of Budapest, Prague, and Amsterdam. These brave, determined Jewish men and women have chosen to settle–or remain–in Europe after the devastation of the Holocaust, but they have paid a price. Among the unexpected dangers, they have had to cope with an alarming resurgence of Nazism in Europe, the spread of Arab terrorism, and the impact of the Jewish state on European life. Delving into the intimate stories of European Jews from all walks of life, Kurlansky weaves together a vivid tapestry of individuals sustaining their traditions, and flourishing, in the shadow of history. An inspiring story of a tenacious people who have rebuilt their lives in the face of incomprehensible horror, A Chosen Few is a testament to cultural survival and a celebration of the deep bonds that endure between Jews and European civilization. “Consistently absorbing . . .

It is that many of the problems we face - from crime to teenage delinquency to traffic jams - behave like epidemics. They aren't linear phenomena in the sense that they steadily and predictably change according to the level of effort brought to bear against them. They are capable of sudden and dramatic changes in direction. Years of well-intentioned intervention may have no impact at all, yet the right intervention - at just the right time - can start a cascade of change. Many of the social ills that face us today, in other words, are as inherently volatile as the epidemics that periodically sweep through the human population: little things can cause them to 'tip' at any time and if we want to understand how to confront and solve them we have to understand what those 'Tipping Points' are. In this revolutionary new study, Malcolm Gladwell explores the ramifications of this. Not simply for politicians and policy-makers, his method provides a new way of viewing everyday experience and enables us to develop strategies for everything from raising a child to running a company.",2000.0,3.95,279.0,1548.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

H. Huxley, Aldous Huxley had a privileged background and was educated at Eton and Oxford despite an eye infection that left him nearly blind. Having learned braille his eyesight then improved enough for him to start writing, and by the 1920s he had become a fashionable figure, producing witty and daring novels like CROME YELLOW (1921), ANTIC HAY (1923) and POINT COUNTER POINT (1928). But it is as the author of his celebrated portrayal of a nightmare future society, BRAVE NEW WORLD (1932), that Huxley is remembered today. A truly visionary book, it was a watershed in Huxley's world-view as his later work became more and more optimistic - coinciding with his move to California and experimentation with mysticism and psychedelic drugs later in life.

""Happiness,"" Forster wrote, ""is its keynote.... In Maurice I tried to create a character who was completely unlike myself or what I supposed myself to be: someone handsome, healthy, bodily attractive, mentally torpid, not a bad businessman and rather a snob.

Exploring the continuities between the romantic and Victorian ""periods"" that have so often been rather read as differences, the book demonstrate that the sublime mode enables the transition from a paradigm of overwhelming power exemplified by the body of the king to the pervasive power of surveillance utilized by the rising middle classes. While the domestic woman connected with the rise of the middle class is normally seen as beautiful, the book contends that the moral authority given to this icon of depth and interiority is actually sublime. The binary of the beautiful and the sublime seeks to contain the sublimity of womanhood by insisting on sublimity's masculine character. This is the book's most important claim: rather than exemplifying masculine strength, the sublime marks the transition to a system of power gendered as feminine and yet masks that transition because it fears the power it ostensibly accords to the feminine. This aesthetic is both an inheritance the Victorians receive from their romantic predecessors, and, more importantly, a broad historical phenomenon that questions the artificial boundaries between romantic and Victorian.",2005.0,4.09,240.0,46.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7498023M/Diana_Wynne_Jones,/books/OL7498023M,240.0,,,Routledge,,"August 26, 2005","[{'name': ""Children's stories"", 'url': ""https://openlibrary.org/subjects/children's_stories""}, {'name': 'English literature, history and criticism, 20th century', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/english_literature,_history_and_criticism,_20th_century'}, {'name': 'Fantasy fiction, history and criticism', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fantasy_fiction,_history_and_criticism'}, {'name': 'Criticism and interpretation', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/criticism_and_interpretation'}, {'name': ""Children's stories, English"", 'url': ""https://openlibrary.org/subjects/children's_stories,_english""}, {'name': 'History and criticism', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history_and_criticism'}, {'name': 'English Fantasy fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/english_fantasy_fiction'}, {'name': 'Children, books and reading', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/children,_books_and_reading'}, {'name': 'Histoires pour enfants anglaises', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/histoires_pour_enfants_anglaises'}, {'name': 'Histoire et critique', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/histoire_et_critique'}, {'name': 'LITERARY CRITICISM', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/literary_criticism'}, {'name': 'European', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/european'}, {'name': 'English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/english,_irish,_scottish,_welsh'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/dianawynnejonesc0000mend', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7498023M/Diana_Wynne_Jones/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['47539'],['949166'],['0415970237'],['OL7498023M'],"['PR6060.O497 Z76 2005', 'PR6060.O497Z76 2005', 'PR6060.O497 Z76 2005eb']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/269880-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/269880-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/269880-L.jpg,The Fantastic Tradition and Children's Literature (Children's Literature and Culture),,['2005003668'],['858861576'],,,,['9780415970235'],,,,,,,,,,

The Culture of Fear describes the high costs of living in a fear-ridden environment where realism has become rarer than doors without deadbolts.Why do we have so many fears these days? Are we living in exceptionally dangerous times? To watch the news, you'd certainly think so, but Glassner demonstrates that it is our perception of danger that has increased, not the actual level of risk. The Culture of Fear is an expose of the people and organizations that manipulate our perceptions and profit from our fears: politicians who win elections by heightening concerns about crime and drug use even as rates for both are declining; advocacy groups that raise money by exaggerating the prevalence of particular diseases; TV newsmagazines that monger a new scare every week to garner ratings.Glassner spells out the prices we pay for social panics: the huge sums of money that go to waste on unnecessary programs and products as well as time and energy spent worrying about our fears.",2000.0,3.7,210.0,3025.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a reality today. The country has gone from the world's largest creditor to its greatest debtor; the value of the dollar is sinking; domestic manufacturing is winding down - and these trends don't seem to be slowing. Peter Schiff casts a sharp, clear-sighted eye on these factors and explains what the possible effects may be and how investors can protect themselves. For more than a decade, Schiff has not only observed the U.S. economy, but also helped his clients reposition their portfolios to reflect his outlook. What he sees is a nation facing an economic storm brought on by growing federal, personal, and corporate debt, too-little savings, a declining dollar, and lack of domestic manufacturing. Crash-Proof is an informed and informative warning of a looming period marked by sizeable tax hikes, loss of retirement benefits, double digit inflation, even - as happened recently in Argentina - the possible collapse of the middle class.

Covington,Travel,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YFp5AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"Lady on the Hill tells the inspiring story of the thirty-five-year effort to restore this fading beauty to her former glory--all without a penny of government funding or outside foundation grants. Central to this true-life tale of rebirth against the odds is George Vanderbilt's grandson William A. V. Cecil, a well-mannered, highly educated man who, when caught up in an idea, becomes a whirling dervish, generating enough energy and enthusiasm to motivate everyone around him. And, according to author Howard Covington Jr., Cecil gets a week's worth of ideas before he's done with his Monday morning shave. In the late 1950s, attorneys, financial managers, and tax accountants were united in advising Cecil and his brother, George, to sell off the estate's 12,000 acres in order to create a suburban subdivision. Cecil quietly ignored this advice and came up with a better idea: over the next four decades, he would turn this down-at-the-heels mansion that was a drain on the family business into the most successful, privately preserved historic site in the United States, perhaps even the world. Cecil succeeded beyond even his wildest dreams. Not only did he raise the money needed to begin and continue a painstaking, decades-long restoration of the house itself, but he also achieved a goal that even his grandfather had found elusive. He made Biltmore Estate a self-sustaining, working enterprise that included a vibrant tourist destination, a working winery and vineyard, and a farming operation; employed hundreds of people; and attracted hundreds of millions of dollars to the local economy every year. Lady on the Hill tells a lively tale of eccentric, upper-crust characters, seemingly insurmountable obstacles, and one man's determination, innovation, loyalty, and stubborn persistence to succeed against the odds. It also provides a brilliant, if unorthodox, model for anyone involved with the preservation and restoration of a historic home.",2006.0,3.89,331.0,371.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the revised edition, a new final chapter covers all the recent international developments in graphic design, including the role of the computer and the Internet in design innovation and globalization. In the last years of the twentieth century, at a time when ""designer products"" and the use of logos grew in importance, the role of graphic designers became more complex, subversive, and sometimes more politicalwitness Oliviero Toscani's notorious advertisements for Benetton. Digital technology cleared the way for an astonishing proliferation of new typefaces, and words began to take second place to typography in a whole range of magazines and books as designers asserted the primacy of their medium. Designers and companies discussed here include Neville Brody, David Carson, Design Writing Research, Edward Fella, Tibor Kalman, Jeffery Keedy, LettError, Pierre di Sciullo, Tomato, Gerard Unger, Cornel Windlin, and a host of others.

But they were more than the critics of Germany's cultural crisis; they were its symptoms and victims as well. Unable to endure the ills which they diagnosed and which they had experienced in their own lives, they sought to become prophets who would point the way to a national rebirth. Hence, they propounded all manner of reforms, ruthless and idealistic, nationalistic and utopian.

Moral Luck contains a number of essays that have contributed influentially to this development. Among the recurring themes are the moral and philosophical limitations of utilitarianism, the notion of integrity, relativism, and problems of moral conflict and rational choice.

The sheer number of false rumors and downright lies disseminated about the man and his films is truly astonishing. Yet Herzog's body of work is one of the most important in postwar European cinema. His international breakthrough came in 1973 with Aguirre, The Wrath of God, in which Klaus Kinski played a crazed Conquistador. For The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, Herzog cast in the lead a man who had spent most of his life institutionalized, and two years later he hypnotized his entire cast to make Heart of Glass. He rushed to an explosive volcanic Caribbean island to film La Soufrière, paid homage to F. W. Murnau in a terrifying remake of Nosferatu, and in 1982 dragged a boat over a mountain in the Amazon jungle for Fitzcarraldo. More recently, Herzog has made extraordinary ""documentary"" films such as Little Dieter Needs to Fly. His place in cinema history is assured, and Paul Cronin's volume of dialogues provides a forum for Herzog's fascinating views on the things, ideas, and people that have preoccupied him for so many years.",2003.0,4.44,352.0,1344.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In The Return of the Shadow (an abandoned title for the first volume) Christopher Tolkien describes, with full citation of the earliest notes, outline plans, and narrative drafts, the intricate evolution of The Fellowship of the Ring and the gradual emergence of the conceptions that transformed what J.R.R. Tolkien for long believed would be a far shorter book, 'a sequel to The Hobbit'. The enlargement of Bilbo's 'magic ring' into the supremely potent and dangerous Ruling Ring of the Dark Lord is traced and the precise moment is seen when, in an astonishing and unforeseen leap in the earliest narrative, a Black Rider first rode into the Shire, his significance still unknown. The character of the hobbit called Trotter (afterwards Strider or Aragorn) is developed while his indentity remains an absolute puzzle, and the suspicion only very slowly becomes certainty that he must after all be a Man. The hobbits, Frodo's companions, undergo intricate permutations of name and personality, and other major figures appear in strange modes: a sinister Treebeard, in league with the Enemy, a ferocious and malevolent Farmer Maggot. The story in this book ends at the point where J.R.R. Tolkien halted in the story for a long time, as the Company of the Ring, still lacking Legolas and Gimli, stood before the tomb of Balin in the Mines of Moria. The Return of the Shadow is illustrated with reproductions of the first maps and notable pages from the earliest manuscripts.",2000.0,4.02,512.0,2263.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In their eagerness to erase all traces of the Third Reich from the earth, the Allies believed that Prussia, the very embodiment of German militarism, had to be abolished. But as Christopher Clark reveals in this pioneering history, Prussia's legacy is far more complex. Though now a fading memory in Europe's heartland, the true story of Prussia offers a remarkable glimpse into the dynamic rise of modern Europe. What we find is a kingdom that existed nearly half a millennium ago as a patchwork of territorial fragments, with neither significant resources nor a coherent culture. With its capital in Berlin, Prussia grew from being a small, poor, disregarded medieval state into one of the most vigorous and powerful nations in Europe. Iron Kingdom traces Prussia's involvement in the continent's foundational religious and political conflagrations: from the devastations of the Thirty Years War through centuries of political machinations to the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, from the enlightenment of Frederick the Great to the destructive conquests of Napoleon, and from the ""iron and blood"" policies of Bismarck to the creation of the German Empire in 1871, and all that implied for the tumultuous twentieth century. By 1947, Prussia was deemed an intolerable threat to the safety of Europe; what is often forgotten, Clark argues, is that it had also been an exemplar of the European humanistic tradition, boasting a formidable government administration, an incorruptible civil service, and religious tolerance.

What could I do then but laugh at Aristotle's Meteorology and his philosophy?"" Acosta's experience echoes that of his fellow travelers to the New World, and it is this experience, with its profound effect on Western culture, that Anthony Grafton charts. Describing an era of exploration that went far beyond geographic bounds, this book shows how the evidence of the New World shook the foundations of the old, upsetting the authority of the ancient texts that had guided Europeans so far afield. The intellectual shift mapped out here, a movement from book learning to empirical knowledge, did not take place easily or quickly, and Grafton presents it in all its drama and complexity. What he recounts is in effect a war of ideas fought, sometimes unwittingly by mariners, scientists, publishers, scholars, and rulers over one hundred fifty years. He shows us explorers from Cortes and Columbus to Scaliger and Munster, laden with ideas gathered from ancient and medieval texts, in their encounters with the world at large. In colorful vignettes, firsthand accounts, published debates, and copious illustrations, we see these men and their contemporaries trying to make sense of their discoveries as they sometimes confirm, sometimes contest, and finally displace traditional images and notions of the world beyond Europe. The fundamental cultural revolution that Grafton documents still reverberates in our time. By taking us into thisbattle of books versus facts, a conflict that has shaped global views for centuries, Grafton allows us to re-experience and understand the Renaissance as it continues to this day.",1992.0,3.58,296.0,70.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of about 106 speeches, delivered before the Roman people or the Senate if they were political, before jurors if judicial, 58 survive (a few of them incompletely). In the fourteenth century Petrarch and other Italian humanists discovered manuscripts containing more than 900 letters of which more than 800 were written by Cicero and nearly 100 by others to him. These afford a revelation of the man all the more striking because most were not written for publication. Six rhetorical works survive and another in fragments.

In early manhood an admirer of Socrates, he later founded the famous school of philosophy in the grove Academus. Much else recorded of his life is uncertain; that he left Athens for a time after Socrates' execution is probable; that later he went to Cyrene, Egypt, and Sicily is possible; that he was wealthy is likely; that he was critical of 'advanced' democracy is obvious. He lived to be 80 years old. Linguistic tests including those of computer science still try to establish the order of his extant philosophical dialogues, written in splendid prose and revealing Socrates' mind fused with Plato's thought. In Laches, Charmides, and Lysis, Socrates and others discuss separate ethical conceptions. Protagoras, Ion, and Meno discuss whether righteousness can be taught. In Gorgias, Socrates is estranged from his city's thought, and his fate is impending. The Apology (not a dialogue), Crito, Euthyphro, and the unforgettable Phaedo relate the trial and death of Socrates and propound the immortality of the soul. In the famous Symposium and Phaedrus, written when Socrates was still alive, we find the origin and meaning of love. Cratylus discusses the nature of language. The great masterpiece in ten books, the Republic, concerns righteousness (and involves education, equality of the sexes, the structure of society, and abolition of slavery). Of the six so-called dialectical dialogues Euthydemus deals with philosophy; metaphysical Parmenides is about general concepts and absolute being; Theaetetus reasons about the theory of knowledge. Of its sequels, Sophist deals with not-being; Politicus with good and bad statesmanship and governments; Philebus with what is good. The Timaeus seeks the origin of the visible universe out of abstract geometrical elements. The unfinished Critias treats of lost Atlantis. Unfinished also is Plato's last work of the twelve books of Laws (Socrates is absent from it), a critical discussion of principles of law which Plato thought the Greeks might accept.

The Constitution of the Athenians, though not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on Athenian politics. Xenophon (ca. 430 to ca. 354 BCE) was a wealthy Athenian and friend of Socrates. He left Athens in 401 and joined an expedition including ten thousand Greeks led by the Persian governor Cyrus against the Persian king. After the defeat of Cyrus, it fell to Xenophon to lead the Greeks from the gates of Babylon back to the coast through inhospitable lands. Later he wrote the famous vivid account of this ""March Up-Country"" (Anabasis); but meanwhile he entered service under the Spartans against the Persian king, married happily, and joined the staff of the Spartan king, Agesilaus. But Athens was at war with Sparta in 394 and so exiled Xenophon. The Spartans gave him an estate near Elis where he lived for years writing and hunting and educating his sons. Reconciled to Sparta, Athens restored Xenophon to honour but he preferred to retire to Corinth. Xenophon's Anabasis is a true story of remarkable adventures. Hellenica, a history of Greek affairs from 411 to 362, begins as a continuation of Thucydides' account. There are four works on Socrates (collected in Volume IV of the Loeb Xenophon edition). In Memorabilia Xenophon adds to Plato's picture of Socrates from a different viewpoint. The Apology is an interesting complement to Plato's account of Socrates' defense at his trial. Xenophon's Symposium portrays a dinner party at which Socrates speaks of love; and Oeconomicus has him giving advice on household management and married life. Cyropaedia, a historical romance on the education of Cyrus (the Elder), reflects Xenophon's ideas about rulers and government; the Loeb edition is in two volumes. We also have his Hiero, a dialogue on government; Agesilaus, in praise of that king; Constitution of Lacedaemon (on the Spartan system); Ways and Means (on the finances of Athens); Manual for a Cavalry Commander; a good manual of Horsemanship; and a lively Hunting with Hounds. The Constitution of the Athenians, though clearly not by Xenophon, is an interesting document on politics at Athens. These eight books are collected in the last of the seven volumes of the Loeb Classical Library edition of Xenophon.",1925.0,3.94,576.0,18.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these, eighteen (plus a play of unknown authorship mistakenly included with his works) have come down to us from antiquity. In this first volume of a new Loeb edition of Euripides David Kovacs gives us a freshly edited Greek text of three plays and an accurate and graceful translation with explanatory notes. Alcestis is the story of a woman who agrees--in order to save her husband's life--to die in his place. Medea is a tragedy of revenge in which Medea kills her own children, as well as their father's new wife to punish him for his desertion. The volume begins with Cyclops, a satyr play--the only complete example of this genre to survive. Each play is preceded by an introduction. In a general introduction Kovacs demonstrates that the biographical tradition about Euripides---parts of which view him as a subverter of morality, religion, and art--cannot be relied on. He argues that this tradition has often furnished the unacknowledged starting point for interpretation, and that the way is now clear for an unprejudiced consideration of the plays themselves.

Scott Fitzgerald,Biography & Autobiography,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1oz-yAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"A vibrant self-portrait of an artist whose work was his life. In this new collection of F. Scott Fitzgerald's letters, edited by leading Fitzgerald scholar and biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli, we see through his own words the artistic and emotional maturation of one of America's most enduring and elegant authors. A Life in Letters is the most comprehensive volume of Fitzgerald's letters -- many of them appearing in print for the first time. The fullness of the selection and the chronological arrangement make this collection the closest thing to an autobiography that Fitzgerald ever wrote. While many readers are familiar with Fitzgerald's legendary ""jazz age"" social life and his friendships with Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Edmund Wilson, and other famous authors, few are aware of his writings about his life and his views on writing. Letters to his editor Maxwell Perkins illustrate the development of Fitzgerald's literary sensibility; those to his friend and competitor Ernest Hemingway reveal their difficult relationship. The most poignant letters here were written to his wife, Zelda, from the time of their courtship in Montgomery, Alabama, during World War I to her extended convalescence in a sanatorium near Asheville, North Carolina. Fitzgerald is by turns affectionate and proud in his letters to his daughter, Scottie, at college in the East while he was struggling in Hollywood. For readers who think primarily of Fitzgerald as a hard-drinking playboy for whom writing was effortless, these letters show his serious, painstaking concerns with creating realistic, durable art.",1995.0,4.24,528.0,178.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse.

But it was not. The Watergate scandal, and the remedies against future abuses of power, would have an enduring impact on presidents and the country. In Shadow, Bob Woodward takes us deep into the administrations of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton to describe how each discovered that the presidency was forever altered. With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive.

Drawing on his own struggles with the illness and interviews with fellow sufferers, doctors and scientists, policy makers and politicians, drug designers and philosophers, Andrew Solomon reveals the subtle complexities and sheer agony of the disease. He confronts the challenge of defining the illness and describes the vast range of available medications, the efficacy of alternative treatments, and the impact the malady has on various demographic populations -- around the world and throughout history. He also explores the thorny patch of moral and ethical questions posed by emerging biological explanations for mental illness. With uncommon humanity, candor, wit, and erudition, award-winning author Solomon takes readers on a journey of incom-parable range and resonance into the most pervasive of family secrets.

It's 1942 and Rocco Raven, an intrepid auto mechanic turned corporal from Brooklyn, has arrived in Malta, a Mediterranean island of Neolithic caves, Copper Age temples, and fortresses. The island is under siege, full of smoke and rubble, caught in the magnesium glare of German and Italian bombs. But nothing is as it seems on Malta. Rocco's living quarters are a brothel; his commanding officer has a genius for turning the war's misfortunes into personal profit; and the Maltese people, astonishingly, testify to the resiliency of the human spirit. When Rocco meets the beautiful and ethereal Melita, who delivers the jukeboxes her cousin builds out of shattered debris, they are drawn to each other by an immediate passion. And, it is their full-blown affair that at once liberates and imprisons Rocco on the island.

Thompson's legions of fans have waited a decade for this book. They will not be disappointed. His notorious Screwjack is as salacious, unsettling, and brutally lyrical as it has been rumored to be since the private printing in 1991 of three hundred fine collectors' copies and twenty-six leather-bound presentation copies. Only the first of the three pieces included here -- ""Mescalito,"" published in Thompson's 1990 collection Songs of the Doomed -- has been available to the public, making the trade edition of Screwjack a major publishing event. ""We live in a jungle of pending disasters,"" Thompson warns in ""Mescalito,"" a chronicle of his first mescaline experience and what it sparked in him while he was alone in an L.A. hotel room in February 1969 -- including a bout of paranoia that would have made most people just scream no, once and for all. But for Thompson, along with the downside came a burst of creativity too powerful to ignore. The result is a poetic, perceptive, and wildly funny stream-of-consciousness take on 1969 America as only Hunter S. Thompson could see it. Screwjack just gets weirder with its second offering, ""Death of a Poet."" As Thompson describes this trailer-park confrontation with the dark side of a deservingly doomed friend: ""Whoops, I thought. Welcome to the night train."" The heart of the collection lies in its final, title piece, an unnaturally poignant love story. What makes the romantic tale ""Screwjack"" so touching, for all its queerness, is the aching melancholy in its depiction of the modern man's burden: that ""we are doomed. Mama has gone off to Real Estate School ...and after that maybe even to Law School. We will never see her again."" Ostensibly written by Raoul Duke, ""Screwjack"" begins with an editor's note explaining of Thompson's alter ego that ""the first few lines contain no warning of the madness and fear and lust that came more and more to plague him and dominate his life...."" ""I am guilty, Lord,"" Thompson writes, ""but I am also a lover -- and I am one of your best people, as you know; and yea tho I have walked in many strange shadows and acted crazy from time to time and even drooled on many High Priests, I have not been an embarrassment to you...."" Nor has Hunter S. Thompson been to American literature. Quite the contrary: What the legendary Gonzo journalist proves with Screwjack is just how brilliant a prose stylist he really is, amid all the hilarity. As Thompson puts it in his introduction, the three stories here ""build like Bolero to a faster & wilder climax that will drag the reader relentlessly up a hill, & then drop him off a cliff....That is the Desired Effect"".",2000.0,3.57,64.0,3363.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9780687002825,0687002826,Exclusion and Embrace,"A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation",Miroslav Volf,Religion,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Cqto7sVhTS8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"Life at the end of the twentieth century presents us with a disturbing reality. Otherness, the simple fact of being different in some way, has come to be defined as in and of itself evil. Miroslav Volf contends that if the healing word of the gospel is to be heard today, Christian theology must find ways of speaking that address the hatred of the other. Reaching back to the New Testament metaphor of salvation as reconciliation, Volf proposes the idea of embrace as a theological response to the problem of exclusion. Increasingly we see that exclusion has become the primary sin, skewing our perceptions of reality and causing us to react out of fear and anger to all those who are not within our (ever-narrowing) circle. In light of this, Christians must learn that salvation comes, not only as we are reconciled to God, and not only as we ""learn to live with one another,"" but as we take the dangerous and costly step of opening ourselves to the other, of enfolding him or her in the same embrace with which we have been enfolded by God. Is there any hope of embracing our enemies? Of opening the door to reconciliation? Miroslav Volf, a Yale University theologian, has won the 2002 Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for his book, Exclusion & Embrace: A Theological Exploration of Identity, Otherness, and Reconciliation (Abingdon, 1996). Volf argues that ""exclusion"" of people who are alien or different is among the most intractable problems in the world today. He writes, ""It may not be too much to claim that the future of our world will depend on how we deal with identity and difference. The issue is urgent. The ghettos and battlefields throughout the world--in the living rooms, in inner cities, or on the mountain ranges--testify indisputably to its importance."" A Croatian by birth, Volf takes as a starting point for his analysis the recent civil war and ""ethnic cleansing"" in the former Yugoslavia, but he readily finds other examples of cultural, ethnic, and racial conflict to illustrate his points. And, since September 11, one can scarcely help but plug the new world players into his incisive descriptions of the dynamics of interethnic and international strife. Exclusion happens, Volf argues, wherever impenetrable barriers are set up that prevent a creative encounter with the other. It is easy to assume that ""exclusion"" is the problem or practice of ""barbarians"" who live ""over there,"" but Volf persuades us that exclusion is all too often our practice ""here"" as well. Modern western societies, including American society, typically recite their histories as ""narratives of inclusion,"" and Volf celebrates the truth in these narratives. But he points out that these narratives conveniently omit certain groups who ""disturb the integrity of their 'happy ending' plots."" Therefore such narratives of inclusion invite ""long and gruesome"" counter-narratives of exclusion--the brutal histories of slavery and of the decimation of Native American populations come readily to mind, but more current examples could also be found. Most proposed solutions to the problem of exclusion have focused on social arrangements--what kind of society ought we to create in order to accommodate individual or communal difference? Volf focuses, rather, on ""what kind of selves we need to be in order to live in harmony with others."" In addressing the topic, Volf stresses the social implications of divine self-giving. The Christian scriptures attest that God does not abandon the godless to their evil, but gives of Godself to bring them into communion. We are called to do likewise--""whoever our enemies and whoever we may be."" The divine mandate to embrace as God has embraced is summarized in Paul's injunction to the Romans: ""Welcome one another, therefore, just as Christ has welcomed you"" (Romans 15:7). Susan R. Garrett, Coordinator of the Religion Award, said that the Grawemeyer selection committee praised Volf's book on many counts. These included its profound interpretation of certain pivotal passages of Scripture and its brilliant engagement with contemporary theology, philosophy, critical theory, and feminist theory. ""Volf's focus is not on social strategies or programs but, rather, on showing us new ways to understand ourselves and our relation to our enemies. He helps us to imagine new possibilities for living against violence, injustice, and deception."" Garrett added that, although addressed primarily to Christians, Volf's theological statement opens itself to religious pluralism by upholding the importance of different religious and cultural traditions for the formation of personal and group identity. The call to ""embrace the other"" is never a call to remake the other into one's own image. Volf--who had just delivered a lecture on the topic of Exclusion and Embrace at a prayer breakfast for the United Nations when the first hijacked plane hit the World Trade Center--will present a lecture and receive his award in Louisville during the first week of April, 2002. The annual Religion Award, which includes a cash prize of $200,000, is given jointly by Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and the University of Louisville to the authors or originators of creative works that contribute significantly to an understanding of ""the relationship between human beings and the divine, and ways in which this relationship may inspire or empower human beings to attain wholeness, integrity, or meaning, either individually or in community."" The Grawemeyer awards--given also by the University of Louisville in the fields of musical composition, education, psychology, and world order--honor the virtue of accessibility: works chosen for the awards must be comprehensible to thinking persons who are not specialists in the various fields.",1996.0,4.27,306.0,1895.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Impossible, says Kevin Trudeau, the world's foremost authority on memory improvement training. There are no bad memories, only untrained memories. In order to release our natural memory, Trudeau says, we just need to learn to retrieve what we already know. As founder of the American Memory Institute, Kevin Trudeau has already helped more than one million people do just that. Each Mega Memory lesson in this book takes no more than thirty minutes per day and uses pictures, rather than the laborious word-association techniques of other memory systems, to activate our inborn memory. With this easy-to-follow system, you'll be able to instantly remember names, phone numbers, addresses, financial data, speeches, and schoolwork. Even better, Trudeau's system ensures instant recall and long-term Mega Memory. All you need is the desire to unleash your Mega Memory, and you can reap all these incredible rewards! Labeled with a learning disability at an early age, Kevin Trudeau was convinced his problem was an inability to recall information. He read everything he could on memory improvement.

Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In Phantoms in the Brain, Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases: A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial. A man who insists he is talking with God challenges us to ask: Could we be ""wired"" for religious experience? A woman who hallucinates cartoon characters illustrates how, in a sense, we are all hallucinating, all the time. Dr. Ramachandran's inspired medical detective work pushes the boundaries of medicine's last great frontier -- the human mind -- yielding new and provocative insights into the ""big questions"" about consciousness and the self.",1999.0,4.25,352.0,14549.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a world full of hope for democratization but wary of government failure, this book offers empirical evidence for the importance of civic community in developing successful institutions. As part of a unique experiment begun in 1970 when Italy created new governments for each of its regions - regions that vary greatly from the standpoint of wealth, social structure, and political leanings - Robert Putnam and his collaborators spent two decades evaluating the performance of these governments in such fields as agriculture, housing, and health services. Their findings were surprising: regions that enjoy effective government in the 1990s have inherited a legacy of civic engagement that can be traced back to the early Middle Ages. Just as Tocqueville traveled to America to try to understand democracy, Putnam and his colleagues draw broad lessons for democratic theory from their twenty-year journey through Italy. Their conclusions challenge the simple-minded thesis of the primacy of economics and the easy optimism of social engineers. Based on dozens of case studies and thousands of interviews with politicians, community leaders, and ordinary citizens, this book illuminates patterns of associationism, trust, and cooperation that facilitate good governance and economic prosperity. It also contributes to the discussion of democracy in the newly freed lands of Eurasia and the developing world and to the gathering debate about how to revitalize democracy in America.",1993.0,3.83,280.0,567.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is now joined by Jürgen Habermas's extensive essay on the issues of recognition and the democratic constitutional state and by K. Anthony Appiah's commentary on the tensions between personal and collective identities, such as those shaped by religion, gender, ethnicity, race, and sexuality, and on the dangerous tendency of multicultural politics to gloss over such tensions.

An exhilarating account of Sapolsky’s twenty-one-year study of a troop of rambunctious baboons in Kenya, A Primate’s Memoir interweaves serious scientific observations with wry commentary about the challenges and pleasures of living in the wilds of the Serengeti—for man and beast alike. Over two decades, Sapolsky survives culinary atrocities, gunpoint encounters, and a surreal kidnapping, while witnessing the encroachment of the tourist mentality on the farthest vestiges of unspoiled Africa. As he conducts unprecedented physiological research on wild primates, he becomes evermore enamored of his subjects—unique and compelling characters in their own right—and he returns to them summer after summer, until tragedy finally prevents him.

Drawing on diaries and memoirs, he brings each engagement to life, from the initial planning to the actual battlefield experiences of soldiers whose exploits at Belleau Woods and along the Meuse-Argonne would become the stuff of legend. Along the way, he shows how General Pershing and other leaders -- including George Marshall, Douglas MacArthur, George Patton, Billy Mitchell, and Peyton March -- transformed the American Expeditionary Force from a small, underequipped force into a strong, efficient, and effective army.

Reeves proves that the Watergate scandal was no abberation in an administration foreshadowed by a series of successful uses of 'national security' to cover coups, burglaries, lies, the abandonment of America's allies - and even murder. Reeves portrays a man of vision and iron will who created, used and was used by a small cast of hard, ambitious men who formed a poisonous circle around their insecure leader. Alone, Nixon challenged and changed the world's political and military balance while also plotting to destroy both the Democratic and Republican parties in an attempt to create secretly a new party of the centre.

A wide variety of extremist groups -- Islamic fundamentalists, neo-Nazis -- share the oddly similar belief that a tiny shadowy elite rule the world from a secret room. In Them, journalist Jon Ronson has joined the extremists to track down the fabled secret room. As a journalist and a Jew, Ronson was often considered one of ""Them"" but he had no idea if their meetings actually took place. Was he just not invited? Them takes us across three continents and into the secret room. Along the way he meets Omar Bakri Mohammed, considered one of the most dangerous men in Great Britain, PR-savvy Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Thom Robb, and the survivors of Ruby Ridge. He is chased by men in dark glasses and unmasked as a Jew in the middle of a Jihad training camp. In the forests of northern California he even witnesses CEOs and leading politicians -- like Dick Cheney and George Bush -- undertake a bizarre owl ritual. Ronson's investigations, by turns creepy and comical, reveal some alarming things about the looking-glass world of ""us"" and ""them.""

But now destiny was about to manifest itself. I felt like it was looking right at me and nobody else.” So writes Bob Dylan in Chronicles: Volume One, his remarkable book exploring critical junctures in his life and career. Through Dylan’s eyes and open mind, we see Greenwich Village, circa 1961, when he first arrives in Manhattan. Dylan’s New York is a magical city of possibilities—smoky, nightlong parties; literary awakenings; transient loves and unbreakable friendships. Elegiac observations are punctuated by jabs of memories, penetrating and tough. With the book’s side trips to New Orleans, Woodstock, Minnesota, and points west, Chronicles: Volume One is an intimate and intensely personal recollection of extraordinary times. By turns revealing, poetical, passionate, and witty, Chronicles: Volume One is a mesmerizing window on Bob Dylan’s thoughts and influences. Dylan’s voice is distinctively American: generous of spirit, engaged, fanciful, and rhythmic. Utilizing his unparalleled gifts of storytelling and the exquisite expressiveness that are the hallmarks of his music, Bob Dylan turns Chronicles: Volume One into a poignant reflection on life, and the people and places that helped shape the man and the art.",2005.0,3.98,320.0,40505.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7928173M/Chronicles,/books/OL7928173M,293.0,,,Simon & Schuster,,"September 13, 2005","[{'name': 'Singers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/singers'}, {'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Biographies', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biographies'}, {'name': 'Chanteurs de folk', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/chanteurs_de_folk'}, {'name': 'Musiciens rock', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/musiciens_rock'}, {'name': 'Musicians, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/musicians,_biography'}, {'name': 'Rock musicians', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/rock_musicians'}, {'name': 'Dylan, bob, 1941-', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/dylan,_bob,_1941-'}, {'name': 'Singers, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/singers,_biography'}, {'name': 'Rock musicians, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/rock_musicians,_biography'}, {'name': 'Autobiography and memoir', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/autobiography_and_memoir'}, {'name': 'Music', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/music'}, {'name': 'Rockmusik', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/rockmusik'}, {'name': 'Memoiren', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/memoiren'}, {'name': 'Rockmusiker', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/rockmusiker'}, {'name': 'Folk', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/folk'}, {'name': '(Musik)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/(musik)'}, {'name': 'Piosenkarze amerykańscy', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/piosenkarze_amerykańscy'}, {'name': 'Biografia', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biografia'}]","[{'name': 'United States', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:united_states'}, {'name': 'USA', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:usa'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/chronicles00bobd', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7928173M/Chronicles/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['14318'],['57342'],['0743244583'],['OL7928173M'],[''],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/473399-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/473399-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/473399-L.jpg,Volume One (Chronicles),,,,,Bob Dylan (1941-),,['9780743244589'],"[{'name': 'od 1945 r.', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/time:od_1945_r.'}]",,,,,,10.4 ounces,,,

Liars and Saints is instructive and bittersweet and yet somehow never nostalgic” (Los Angeles Times). Set in California, Liars and Saints follows four generations of the Catholic Santerre family from World War II to the present. In a family driven as much by jealousy and propriety as by love, an unspoken tradition of deceit is passed from generation to generation. When tragedy shatters their precarious domestic lives, it takes astonishing courage and compassion to bring them back together. By turns funny and disturbing, irreverent and profound, Liars and Saints is a masterful display of Maile Meloy’s prodigious gifts and of her penetrating insight into an extraordinary American family and into the nature of human love. “Meloy may be the first great American realist of the twenty-first century: The Santerres aren’t real but they feel like they are, and the reader will not soon forget them” (The Boston Globe).",2004.0,3.59,272.0,2206.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7947974M/Liars_and_Saints,/books/OL7947974M,272.0,,,Scribner,,"June 29, 2004","[{'name': 'Parent and adult child', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/parent_and_adult_child'}, {'name': 'Parent and adult child in fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/parent_and_adult_child_in_fiction'}, {'name': 'Conflict of generations', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/conflict_of_generations'}, {'name': 'Fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction'}, {'name': 'Conflict of generations in fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/conflict_of_generations_in_fiction'}, {'name': 'Fiction, historical, general', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_historical,_general'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/liarssaints00mail', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7947974M/Liars_and_Saints/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['17671'],['92325'],['0743261984'],['OL7947974M'],,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/474322-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/474322-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/474322-L.jpg,A Novel,,,,,,"THEY WERE MARRIED during the war, in Santa Barbara, after Mass one morning in the old Mission church.",['9780743261982'],,,,,,,7.2 ounces,,,

Fans of Viorst’s funny, touching, and wise decades poems will love these verses filled with witty advice and reflections on marriage, milestones, and middle-aged children. Viorst explores, among the many other issues of this stage of life, the state of our sex lives and teeth, how we can stay married though thermostatically incompatible, and the joys of grandparenthood and shopping. Readers will nod with rueful recognition when she asks, “Am I required to think of myself as a basically shallow woman because I feel better when my hair looks good?,” when she presses a few helpful suggestions on her kids because “they may be middle aged, but they’re still my children,” and when she graciously—but not too graciously—selects her husband’s next mate in a poem deliciously subtitled “If I Should Die Before I Wake, Here’s the Wife You Next Should Take.” Though Viorst acknowledges she is definitely not a good sport about the fact that she is mortal, her poems are full of the pleasures of life right now, helping us come to terms with the passage of time, encouraging us to keep trying to fix the world, and inviting us to consider “drinking wine, making love, laughing hard, caring hard, and learning a new trick or two as part of our job description at seventy.” I'm Too Young to Be Seventy is a joy to read and makes a heartwarming gift for anyone who has reached or is soon to reach that—it’s not so bad after all—seventh decade.",2005.0,3.94,64.0,188.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For thousands of years the untouchables, or Dalits, the people at the bottom of the Hindu caste system, have been treated as subhuman. Their story has rarely been told. This remarkable book achieves something altogether unprecedented: it gives voice to India's voiceless. In Untouchables, Narendra Jadhav tells the awe-inspiring story of his family's struggle for equality and justice in India. While most Dalits had accepted their lowly position as fate, Jadhav's father rebelled against the oppressive caste system and fought against all odds to forge for his children a destiny that was never ordained. Based on his father's diaries and family stories, Jadhav has written the triumphant story of his parents -- their great love, unwavering courage, and eventual victory in the struggle to free themselves and their children from the caste system. Jadhav vividly brings his parents' world to light and unflinchingly documents the life of untouchables -- the hunger, the cruel humiliations, the perpetual fear and brutal abuse. Compelling and deeply compassionate, Untouchables is a son's tribute to his parents, an illuminating chronicle of one of the most important moments in Indian history, and an eye-opening work of nonfiction that gives readers access and insight into the lives of India's 165 million Dalits, whose struggle for equality continues even today.",2005.0,3.82,320.0,299.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7948323M/Untouchables,/books/OL7948323M,307.0,,,Scribner,,"September 27, 2005","[{'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Economists', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/economists'}, {'name': 'Monetary reformers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/monetary_reformers'}, {'name': 'Dalits', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/dalits'}, {'name': 'Social conditions', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/social_conditions'}, {'name': 'People with social disabilities', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/people_with_social_disabilities'}, {'name': 'Economists, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/economists,_biography'}, {'name': 'Reformers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/reformers'}, {'name': 'India, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/india,_biography'}, {'name': 'India, social conditions', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/india,_social_conditions'}]","[{'name': 'India', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:india'}, {'name': 'Maharashtra', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:maharashtra'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/untouchablesmyfa0000jadh', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7948323M/Untouchables/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['165'],['625706'],['0743270797'],['OL7948323M'],"['HB126.I43 J3313 2005', 'HB126.I43J3313 2005']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/474745-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/474745-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/474745-L.jpg,My Family's Triumphant Journey Out of the Caste System in Modern India,,['2005044166'],['59712234'],,Narendra Jadhav (1953-),,['9780743270793'],"[{'name': '20th century', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/time:20th_century'}]",,,,,,1 pounds,,,

9780743464796,0743464796,Pendulum,Leon Foucault and the Triumph of Science,Amir D. Aczel,Biography & Autobiography,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=GKhhPwAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"He was neither a mathematician nor a trained physicist and yet Léon Foucault always knew that a mysterious force of nature was among us. Like Newton, Galileo, Copernicus, and others before him, Foucault sensed a dramatic relationship between the rotating skies above and the seemingly motionless ground beneath our feet. But it wasn't until 1851 -- in Paris, inside the Panthéon, and in the company of fellow amateur scientist Napoleon III -- that Foucault swung a pendulum and demonstrated an extraordinary truth about the world: that it turns on its axis. Pendulum is a fascinating journey through the mind and findings of one of the most important and lesser-known characters in the history of science. Through careful research and lively anecdotes, world-renowned author Amir D. Aczel reveals the astonishing range and breadth of Foucault's discoveries. For, in addition to offering the first unequivocal proof of Earth's rotation, Foucault gave us the modern electric compass and microscope, was a pioneer in photographic technology, and made remarkable deductions about color theory, heat waves, and the speed of light. At its heart, Pendulum is a story about the illustrious period in France during the Second Empire; the crucial triumph of science over religion; and, most compelling, the life of a struggling, self-made man whose pursuit of knowledge continues to inform our notions about the universe today.",2004.0,3.72,288.0,179.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7950640M/Pendulum,/books/OL7950640M,288.0,,,Washington Square Press,,"September 14, 2004","[{'name': 'Religion and science', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/religion_and_science'}, {'name': 'Scientists', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/scientists'}, {'name': 'Physicists', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/physicists'}, {'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'Exacte wetenschappen', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/exacte_wetenschappen'}, {'name': 'PHYSICS', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/physics'}, {'name': 'SCIENTISTS', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/scientists'}, {'name': 'BIOGRAPHY', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'HISTORIES', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/histories'}, {'name': 'Fysik', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fysik'}, {'name': 'Historia', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/historia'}, {'name': 'Religion och vetenskap', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/religion_och_vetenskap'}, {'name': ""Foucault's pendulum"", 'url': ""https://openlibrary.org/subjects/foucault's_pendulum""}, {'name': 'Physicists, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/physicists,_biography'}]","[{'name': 'France', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:france'}]",,['17845'],['207059'],['0743464796'],['OL7950640M'],['QC15'],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/478033-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/478033-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/478033-L.jpg,Leon Foucault and the Triumph of Science,,,,,Léon Foucault (1819-1868),"From his journal, we know that he made the discovery at exactly two o'clock in the morning on January 6, 1851.",['9780743464796'],"[{'name': '19th century', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/time:19th_century'}]",,,,,,8 ounces,,,

Traditional time management suggests that working harder, smarter and faster will help you gain control of your life, and that increased control will bring peace and fulfilment. The authors of FIRST THINGS FIRST disagree. In the first real breakthrough in time management in years, Stephen R. Covey, A. Roger Merrill and Rebecca R. Merrill apply the insights of the 7 HABITS to the daily problems of people who must struggle with the ever increasing demands of work and home life. Rather than focusing on time and things, FIRST THINGS FIRST emphasises relationships and results. And instead of efficiency, this new approach emphasises effectiveness.

This was a military expedition into hostile territory'. In 1803 President Thomas Jefferson selected his personal secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, to lead a pioneering voyage across the Great Plains and into the Rockies. It was completely uncharted territory; a wild, vast land ruled by the Indians. Charismatic and brave, Lewis was the perfect choice and he experienced the savage North American continent before any other white man. UNDAUNTED COURAGE is the tale of a hero, but it is also a tragedy. Lewis may have received a hero's welcome on his return to Washington in 1806, but his discoveries did not match the president's fantasies of sweeping, fertile plains ripe for the taking. Feeling the expedition had been a failure, Lewis took to drink and piled up debts. Full of colourful characters - Jefferson, the president obsessed with conquering the west; William Clark, the rugged frontiersman; Sacagawea, the Indian girl who accompanied the expedition; Drouillard, the French-Indian hunter - this is one of the great adventure stories of all time and it shot to the top of the US bestseller charts.

Never Go Home Again is the story of Corey Dixon, a young man whose father tries as best he can to steer him away from the lure of the streets. And yet, like so many others in his neighborhood, Corey finds the lucrative drug trade too tempting to resist. While he makes fast money for a while, ultimately Corey must pay the price for his choice of his profession: his freedom. By the age of sixteen, Corey is sentenced to prison. Incarcerated at Riker's Island, Corey lives through experiences that threaten to destroy his body, his mind, and his spirit. Still, in the midst of his horrific imprisonment, he discovers inner strength and -- against unimaginable odds -- manages to survive. Corey makes a new kind of family for himself in jail, including a teacher who encourages him to ""never go home again."" In the course of his journey of self-discovery, Corey comes to realize the wisdom in his mentor's words. Unflinching and riveting, Never Go Home Again is a powerful, true-to-life story of redemption that no reader will soon forget.",2005.0,4.04,320.0,217.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7951604M/Never_Go_Home_Again,/books/OL7951604M,336.0,,,Atria,,"September 27, 2005","[{'name': 'Drug dealers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/drug_dealers'}, {'name': 'Prisoners', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/prisoners'}, {'name': 'Fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction'}, {'name': 'African American teenagers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/african_american_teenagers'}, {'name': 'African American young men', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/african_american_young_men'}, {'name': 'Conflict of generations', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/conflict_of_generations'}, {'name': 'Fathers and sons', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fathers_and_sons'}, {'name': 'Street life', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/street_life'}, {'name': 'Fiction, general', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_general'}]","[{'name': 'New York', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:new_york'}, {'name': 'New York (State)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:new_york_(state)'}]",,['28915'],['685732'],['0743496167'],['OL7951604M'],['PS3608.O494356'],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/479396-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/479396-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/479396-L.jpg,A Novel,,,,,,"Damn!

His work is a powerful, often explosive combination of Lacanian psychoanalysis and philosophy which tests key psychoanalytical concepts against the ideas of major European thinkers, especially Hegel. It has ignited enthusiasm and stimulated new approaches across a vast range of disciplines, and seems to be attracting an ever-growing readership. In part, this is because Zizek himself has a panoramic range of interests encompassing film studies, literature, cyber culture, ethics, theology and, above all, politics. It is also because he is a highly entertaining writer, having a flair for anecdote, a smutty sense of humour and the knack of capturing complex ideas in concrete form. Sarah Kay's book provides a lucid and comprehensive introduction to Zizek's work. His writings to date are presented and evaluated here for the first time, together with an outline of their development and explanations of his key premises, themes and terms.

Brand New Justice, now in a revised paperback edition, systematically analyses the success stories of the Top Thirteen nations, demonstrating that their wealth is based on the 'last mile' of the commercial process: buying raw materials and manufacturing cheaply in third world countries, these countries realise their lucrative profits by adding value through finishing, packaging and marketing and then selling the branded product on to the end-user at a hugely inflated price. The use of sophisticated global media techniques alongside a range of creative marketing activities are the lynchpins of this process. Applying his observations on economic history and the development and impact of global marketing, Anholt presents a cogent plan for developing nations to benefit from globalization. So long the helpless victim of capitalist trading systems, he shows that they can cross the divide and graduate from supplier nation to producer nation. Branding native produce on a global scale, making a commercial virtue out of perceived authenticity and otherness and fully capitalising on the 'last mile' benefits are key to this graduation and fundamental to forging a new global economic balance. Anholt argues with a forceful logic, but also backs his hypothesis with enticing glimpses of this process actually beginning to take place. Examining activities in India, Thailand, Russia and Africa among others, he shows the risks, challenges and pressures inherent in 'turning the tide', but above all he demonstrates the very real possibility of enlightened capitalism working as a force for good in global terms. * Controversial and thought-provoking analysis of issues that are central to 21st century economic thought; radical new thinking on wealth-creation in the developing world. * Unites world-class branding and marketing knowledge with an emerging-market development agenda. * Concrete answers to the problems of anti-capitalism, medium level poverty and the brand backlash; a way for the marketing and advertising industries to regain respect and a more positive reputation",2005.0,3.69,184.0,15.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reasons behind this British decision, and its disastrous and inevitable consequences in the South Atlantic, are the main story of this book. There were three main players in the war, each of them trying to overcome their own cultural baggage. The Argentines were riddled with guilt: after years of fighting a morally repugnant campaign against its own people, the Argentine military saw a war for the Malvinas islands as a perfect opportunity to win back their self-respect. The hands of the Americans were also bloody from the likewise dirty wars they had sponsored and abetted in Central America.

He appeared before her in her father's house, filthy from the desert, tired and thirsty. But as the dirt of travel was washed from his body, the sight of him filled her heart. And when Abram promises Sarai to return in ten years to take her for his wife, her fate was sealed. Abram kept his promise, and Sarai kept hers they were wed, and so joined the royal house of Ur with the high priesthood of the Hebrews. So began a lifetime of great joy together, and greater peril: and with the blessing of their God, a great nation would be built around the core of their love. Bestselling author Orson Scott Card uses his fertile imagination, and uncanny insight into human nature, to tell the story of a unique woman--one who is beautiful, tough, smart, and resourceful in an era when women had little power, and are scarce in the historical record. Sarah, child of the desert, wife of Abraham, takes on vivid reality as a woman desirable to kings, a devoted wife, and a faithful follower of the God of Abraham, chosen to experience an incomparable miracle.",2001.0,3.88,341.0,9669.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL40279619M/Sarah,/books/OL40279619M,,,,Forge,,2001-09,"[{'name': 'Bible', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/bible'}, {'name': 'History of Biblical events', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history_of_biblical_events'}, {'name': 'Women in the Bible', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/women_in_the_bible'}, {'name': 'Fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction'}, {'name': 'Fiction, religious', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_religious'}, {'name': 'Fiction, historical', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_historical'}, {'name': 'Bible, history of biblical events, fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/bible,_history_of_biblical_events,_fiction'}, {'name': 'Fiction, historical, general', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/fiction,_historical,_general'}, {'name': 'Femmes dans la Bible', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/femmes_dans_la_bible'}, {'name': 'Romans, nouvelles', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/romans,_nouvelles'}, {'name': 'Bible fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/bible_fiction'}, {'name': 'Biographical fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biographical_fiction'}, {'name': 'Religious fiction', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/religious_fiction'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/sarah0000card_w7h1', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL40279619M/Sarah/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",,,['0765341174'],['OL40279619M'],,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12996028-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12996028-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/12996028-L.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When ""Ender's Game"" was first published as a novella twenty-five years ago few would have predicted that it would become one of the most successful ventures in publishing history. Expanded into a novel in 1985, Ender's Game won both the Hugo Award and the Nebula Award for Best Novel. Never out of print and translated into dozens of languages, it is the rare work of fiction that can truly be said to have transcended a genre. Ender's Game and its sequels have won dozens of prestigious awards and are as popular today among teens and young readers as adults. First Meetings is a collection of three novellas-plus the original ""Ender's Game""-that journey into the origins and the destiny of one Ender Wiggin. ""The Polish Boy"" begins in the wake between the first two Bugger Wars when the Hegemony is desperate to recruit brilliant military commanders to repel the alien invasion. In John Paul Wiggin-the future father of Ender -they believe they may have found their man. Or boy. In ""Teacher's Pest""-a novella written especially for this collection-a brilliant but insufferably arrogant John Paul Wiggin, now an American university student, matches wits with an equally brilliant graduate student named Theresa Brown. It is many years since the end of the Bugger Wars in ""The Investment Counselor."" Ender's reputation as a hero and savior has suffered a horrible reversal. Banished from Earth and slandered as a mass murderer, twenty-year-old Andrew Wiggin wanders incognito from planet to planet as a fugitive. Until a blackmailing tax inspector compromises his identity and threatens to expose Ender the Xenocide. Also reprinted here is the original landmark novella, ""Ender's Game,"" which first appeared in 1977. Fully illustrated, First Meetings is Orson Scott Card writing at the height of his considerable power about his most compelling character.

At a time when more and more women are trying to get pregnant at increasingly advanced ages, fertility specialists and homeopathic researchers boast endless treatment options. But when Julia Indichova made the rounds of medical doctors and nontraditional healers, she was still unable to conceive a child. It was only when she forsook their financially and emotionally draining advice, turning inward instead, that she finally met with reproductive success.Inconceivablerecounts this journey from hopeless diagnoses to elated motherhood. Anyone who has faced infertility will relate to Julia’s desperate measures: acupuncture, unidentifiable black-and-white pellets, herb soup, foul-smelling fruit, even making love on red sheets. Five reproductive endocrinologists told her that there was no documented case of anyone in her hormonal condition getting pregnant, forcing her to finally embark on her own intuitive regimen. After eight caffeine-free, nutrient-rich, yoga-laden months, complemented by visualization exercises, Julia received amazing news; incredibly, she was pregnant. Nine months later she gave birth to a healthy girl. Unlike the many infertility books that take a clinical “how to” approach,Inconceivablesimply professes the wisdom of giving expert status back to the patient. Julia’s self-discovery, and her ability to see her body as an ally once again, yield a beautiful message about the importance of honoring the body’s innate powers, and the power of life itself.",2001.0,3.82,224.0,163.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24752903M/Inconceivable,/books/OL24752903M,186.0,"xv, 186 p. :",Julia Indichova ; [foreword by Christiane Northrup],Broadway Books,New York,2001,"[{'name': 'Patients', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/patients'}, {'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Female Infertility', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/female_infertility'}, {'name': 'Alternative treatment', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/alternative_treatment'}, {'name': 'Infertility', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/infertility'}, {'name': 'Infertility, female', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/infertility,_female'}, {'name': 'Women, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/women,_biography'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/inconceivablewom00indi', 'availability': 'restricted', 'formats': {}}]",,,['0767908201'],['OL24752903M'],"['RG201 .I53 2001', 'RG201.I53 2001']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6806647-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6806647-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/6806647-L.jpg,a woman's triumph over despair and statistics,Includes bibliographical references (p. 182-184).,['2001035492'],['46872412'],"['362.1/98178/0092', 'B']",Julia Indichova,,['9780767908207'],,,,,,,,,,

Their promise is written in the blood of the moon."" -From the Koran, chap. 9, v. 112 The conflict between Islam and the West existed long before the destruction of the World Trade Center and the other events that recently touched America. It goes back hundreds, even thousands, of years. Yet the struggle is upon us now as never before. In this well-reasoned, accessible book, Middle East expert George Grant answers the troubling questions on many believers' minds. Who are the followers of Islam, and what do they believe? What could have motivated those who carried out the acts of terror on September 11? Why has there been tension between Islam and the West for centuries? What are the true meanings of terms such as Ji'had, Intifada, and Dhimma? And is there any hope for peace? The call upon believers now-as always-is to prepare and equip ourselves so that we may stand fast. The Blood of the Moon will help readers better understand the history of Islam and its struggle with the Western world, as well as how Christians can share the message of salvation through Jesus Christ with the followers of Allah.",2001.0,3.69,224.0,70.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few writers of any age have described the pleasures and torments of erotic love with such un-sentimental directness and sensual precision.

Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech's CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni's utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight. Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.",2002.0,4.02,227.0,57971.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nichols Jr., offers precise yet unusually readable translations of two great Platonic dialogues on rhetoric. The Gorgias presents an intransigent argument that justice is superior to injustice: To the extent that suffering an injustice is preferable to committing an unjust act. The dialogue contains some of Plato's most significant and famous discussions of major political themes, and focuses dramatically and with unrivaled intensity on Socrates as a political thinker and actor. Featuring some of Plato's most soaringly lyrical passages, the Phaedrus investigates the soul's erotic longing and its relationship to the whole cosmos, as well as inquiring into the nature of rhetoric and the problem of writing. Nichols's attention to dramatic detail brings the dialogues to life. Plato's striking variety in conversational address (names and various terms of relative warmth and coolness) is carefully reproduced, as is alteration in tone and implication even in the short responses. The translations render references to the gods accurately and non-monotheistically for the first time, and include a fascinating variety of oaths and invocations. A general introduction on rhetoric from the Greeks to the present shows the problematic relation of rhetoric to philosophy and politics, states the themes that unite the two dialogues, and outlines interpretive suggestions that are then developed more fully for each dialogue. The twin dialogues reveal both the private and the political rhetoric emphatic in Plato's philosophy, yet often ignored in commentaries on it. Nichols believes that Plato's thought on rhetoric has been largely misunderstood, and he uses his translations as an opportunity to reconstruct the classical position on right relations between thought and public activity.",1998.0,4.41,233.0,15.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Andrewes,Science,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eKofHQAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"The Illustrated Longitude recounts in words and images the epic quest to solve the greatest scientific problem of the eighteenth and three prior centuries: determining how a captain could pinpoint his ship's location at sea. All too often throughout the ages of exploration, voyages ended in disaster when crew and cargo were either lost at sea or destroyed upon the rocks of an unexpected landfall. Thousands of lives and the fortunes of nations hung on a resolution to the longitude problem. To encourage a solution, governments established prizes for anyone whose method or device proved successful. The largest reward of £20,000 - truly a king's ransom - was offered by Britain's Parliament in 1714. The scientific establishment - from Galileo to Sir Isaac Newton - had been certain that a celestial answer would be found and invested untold effort in this pursuit. By contrast, John Harrison imagined and built the unimaginable: a clock that told perfect time at sea, known today as the chronometer. Harrison's trials and tribulations during his forty-year quest to win the prize are the culmination of this remarkable story. The Illustrated Longitude brings a new and important dimension to Dava Sobel's celebrated story. It contains the entire original narrative of Longitude, redesigned to accompany 183 images chosen by William Andrewes - from portraints of every important figure in the story to maps and diagrams, scientifc instruments, and John Harrison's remarkable sea clocks themselves. Andrewes's elegant captions and sidebars on scientific and historical events tell their own story of longitude.",2003.0,4.09,224.0,166.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Noted New Testament scholar Richard Bauckham challenges the prevailing assumption that the accounts of Jesus circulated as anonymous community traditions, asserting instead that they were transmitted in the names of the original eyewitness. To drive home this controversial point, Bauckham draws on internal literary evidence, the use of personal names in first-century Jewish Palestine, and recent developments in the understanding of oral tradition. ""Jesus and the Eyewitnesses"" also taps into the rich resources of modern study of memory, especially in cognitive psychology, refuting the conclusions of the form critics and calling New Testament scholarship to make a clean break with this long-dominant tradition. Finally, Bauckham challenges readers to end the classic division between the historical Jesus and the Christ of faith, proposing instead the Jesus of testimony as presented by the Gospels. Sure to ignite heated debate on the precise character of the testimony about Jesus, ""Jesus and the Eyewitnesses"" is a groundbreaking work that will be valued by scholars, students, and all who seek to understand the origins of the Gospels.",2006.0,4.3,538.0,632.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7903644M/Jesus_and_the_Eyewitnesses,/books/OL7903644M,538.0,,,Wm.

Miller In this remarkable, acclaimed history of the development of monotheism, Mark S. Smith explains how Israel's religion evolved from a cult of Yahweh as a primary deity among many to a fully defined monotheistic faith with Yahweh as sole god. Repudiating the traditional view that Israel was fundamentally different in culture and religion from its Canaanite neighbors, this provocative book argues that Israelite religion developed, at least in part, from the religion of Canaan. Drawing on epigraphic and archaeological sources, Smith cogently demonstrates that Israelite religion was not an outright rejection of foreign, pagan gods but, rather, was the result of the progressive establishment of a distinctly separate Israelite identity. This thoroughly revised second edition ofThe Early History of God includes a substantial new preface by the author and a foreword by Patrick D.

Petri;Lori Utecht,Biography & Autobiography,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=LHXWwAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"Black Elk Speaks is the story of the Lakota visionary and healer Nicholas Black Elk (1863-1950) and his people during the momentous twilight years of the nineteenth century. Black Elk met the distinguished poet, writer, and critic John G. Neihardt (1881-1973) in 1930 on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and chose Neihardt to tell his story. Neihardt understood and conveyed Black Elk’s experiences in this powerful and inspirational message for all humankind. When Black Elk received his great vision, white settlers were invading the Lakotas’ homeland, decimating buffalo herds, and threatening to extinguish the Lakotas’ way of life. The Lakotas fought fiercely to retain their freedom and way of life, a dogged resistance that resulted in a remarkable victory at the Little Bighorn and an unspeakable tragedy at Wounded Knee. Black Elk Speaks offers much more than a precious glimpse of a vanished time, however. As related by Neihardt, Black Elk’s searing visions of the unity of humanity and the earth have made this book a venerated spiritual classic. Whether appreciated as the poignant tale of a Lakota life, a history of a Native nation, or an enduring spiritual testament, Black Elk Speaks is unforgettable. This new edition features two additional essays by John G. Neihardt that further illuminate his experience with Black Elk; an essay by Alexis Petri, great-granddaughter of John G. Neihardt, that celebrates Neihardt’s remarkable accomplishments; and a look at the legacy of the special relationship between Neihardt and Black Elk, written by Lori Utecht, editor of Knowledge and Opinion: Essays and Literary Criticism of John G.

Given shelter by a Christian farming community, everyone looks to him for help, including one of his chief persecutors. When, after cruel torture, Father Ferriera apostatizes to the disbelief of his Japanese converts, the play reaches a climax that is later capped only by the courage, nobility and love of the martyrs.

First published in 1963, Eight Men Out has become a timeless classic. Eliot Asinof has reconstructed the entire scene-by-scene story of the fantastic scandal in which eight Chicago White Sox players arranged with the nation's leading gamblers to throw the Series in Cincinnati. Mr. Asinof vividly describes the tense meetings, the hitches in the conniving, the actual plays in which the Series was thrown, the Grand Jury indictment, and the famous 1921 trial. Moving behind the scenes, he perceptively examines the motives and backgrounds of the players and the conditions that made the improbable fix all too possible. Here, too, is a graphic picture of the American underworld that managed the fix, the deeply shocked newspapermen who uncovered the story, and the war-exhausted nation that turned with relief and pride to the Series, only to be rocked by the scandal. Far more than a superbly told baseball story, this is a compelling slice of American history in the aftermath of World War I and at the cusp of the Roaring Twenties.",2000.0,4.02,336.0,8287.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7932636M/Eight_Men_Out,/books/OL7932636M,328.0,,,Owl Books,,"May 1, 2000","[{'name': 'Chicago White Sox (Baseball team)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/chicago_white_sox_(baseball_team)'}, {'name': 'World Series (Baseball) (1919)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/world_series_(baseball)_(1919)'}, {'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'Black Sox scandal', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/black_sox_scandal'}, {'name': 'World Series (Baseball)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/world_series_(baseball)'}, {'name': 'Chicago white sox (baseball team)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/chicago_white_sox_(baseball_team)'}, {'name': 'World series (baseball)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/world_series_(baseball)'}, {'name': 'Baseball, history', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/baseball,_history'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/eightmenoutblack0000asin', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL7932636M/Eight_Men_Out/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['11002'],['62012'],['0805065377'],['OL7932636M'],['HV6768'],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/580624-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/580624-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/580624-L.jpg,The Black Sox and the 1919 World Series,,,['44393118'],,Arnold Rothstein (died 1928),"On the morning of October 1, 1919, the sun rose in a clear blue sky over the city of Cincinnati.",['9780805065374'],,,,,,,11.4 ounces,,,

Subjects of the stories include Arachne and Niobe; Tereus, Procne, and Philomela; Medea and Jason; Orpheus and Eurydice; and many others, familiar and unfamiliar. For students of Latin-and teachers, too-they provide an interesting experience. In his introduction the editor discusses Ovid’s career, the reputation of the Metamorphoses during Ovid’s time and after, and the various manuscripts that exist or have been known to exist. He describes the general plan of the poem, its main theme, and the problem of its tone. Technical matters, such as style and meter, are also considered.

Now in development for TV! Since its debut in 1990, The Wheel of Time® by Robert Jordan has captivated millions of readers around the globe with its scope, originality, and compelling characters. The Wheel of Time turns and Ages come and go, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth returns again. In the Third Age, an Age of Prophecy, the World and Time themselves hang in the balance. What was, what will be, and what is, may yet fall under the Shadow. On the slopes of Shayol Ghul, the Myrddraal swords are forged, and the sky is not the sky of this world; In Salidar the White Tower in exile prepares an embassy to Caemlyn, where Rand Al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, holds the throne--and where an unexpected visitor may change the world.... In Emond's Field, Perrin Goldeneyes, Lord of the Two Rivers, feels the pull of ta'veren to ta'veren and prepares to march... Morgase of Caemlyn finds a most unexpected, and quite unwelcome, ally....And south lies Illian, where Sammael holds sway...

[and] demonstrated the power of the common people in a manner which no subsequent government has ever allowed itself to forget."" We can learn a great deal from studying the French Revolution itself, but we can also learn from studying the ways in which scholars have interpreted the French Revolution, and from the ways their views have changed. For over a century following the Revolution, commentators and scholars spoke of it in glowing terms. But in the past three decades, revisionist historians have become skeptical. Eric Hobsbawm reiterates the centrality of the Revolution for history on a global basis. He argues that those who wrote about the Revolution in the nineteenth century were convinced it had changed their lives dramatically, improving the economy and the lot of peasants. They saw the Revolution as a prototype of of the bourgeois revolution, enabling the middle class to gain power from the ruling class of aristocrats. Many believed proletarian revolutions would inevitably follow. In the years between 1917 and the 1960s, Marxists continued to use the French Revolution as a point of reference, paying increasing attention to the social and economic factors in the Revolution, not only to the political factors. In the 1970s and 1980s, many historians began to argue that the Revolution achieved modest results at disproportionate costs. Hobsbawm argues that this massive historiographical reaction against the centrality of the Revolution reflects the personal politics of those contemporary historians for whom Marxism and communism are now out of favor. They are, he maintains, wrong. The Revolution transformed the world permanently and introduced forces that continue to transform it.",1990.0,3.51,168.0,54.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The volume provides students with imaginative, connected reading, beginning with introductory prose versions of Ovid's simple myth tales and progressing to the rich poetry of Ovidian Latin (with appropriate teaching aids) within forty lessons. The grammatical approach is traditional, but the central emphasis is on reading. In each chapter the reading appears first, followed by the vocabulary, the grammar, exercises, and etymology relating to the vocabulary. The exercises begin with a group of questions in Latin (based on the reading), to be answered in Latin. Each tale is preceded by a brief discussion in English of the story and its mythological significance. The myths retold by Ovid and the attractive format are conceived to impel the student into acquiring the skill to read the author in the original language.

Imprisoned by the Fascists for much of his adult life, Gramsci wrote brilliantly on a broad range of subjects: from folklore to philosophy, popular culture to political strategy.

Fifty years after the novel's publication, Warren's characters still stand as powerful representations of the moral dilemmas faced by individuals in positions of power. All the King's Men had its genesis in Warren's stage play Proud Flesh, unpublished in his lifetime. He also wrote a subsequent unpublished play titled Willie Stark: His Rise and Fall and a later dramatic version of the novel that shared the title All the King's Men. This volume is the first to collect all three dramatic texts and to publish Proud Flesh and Willie Stark. Proud Flesh is particularly fascinating for what it reveals about the development of All the King's Men and Warren's changing perceptions of its characters and themes. The other plays, as post-novel writings, provide a forum for Warren to clarify his intentions in the novel. The editors' introduction to this collection reviews the composition history of the works and their relationship to the novel and to each other. The new perspectives on Warren's writing presented in Robert Penn Warren's ""All the King's Men"": Three Stage Versions provide a glimpse into a creative mind struggling with a compelling story and offer readers another way of looking at this American classic. This book is an essential reference in Warren studies that will give students of All the King's Men another context from which to consider Warren's novel.",2000.0,4.0,264.0,3.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lowe discusses the contradictions whereby Asians have been included in the workplaces and markets of the U.S. nation-state, yet, through exclusion laws and bars from citizenship, have been distanced from the terrain of national culture. Lowe argues that a national memory haunts the conception of Asian American, persisting beyond the repeal of individual laws and sustained by U.S. wars in Asia, in which the Asian is seen as the perpetual immigrant, as the “foreigner-within.” In Immigrant Acts, she argues that rather than attesting to the absorption of cultural difference into the universality of the national political sphere, the Asian immigrant—at odds with the cultural, racial, and linguistic forms of the nation—displaces the temporality of assimilation. Distance from the American national culture constitutes Asian American culture as an alternative site that produces cultural forms materially and aesthetically in contradiction with the institutions of citizenship and national identity. Rather than a sign of a “failed” integration of Asians into the American cultural sphere, this critique preserves and opens up different possibilities for political practice and coalition across racial and national borders. In this uniquely interdisciplinary study, Lowe examines the historical, political, cultural, and aesthetic meanings of immigration in relation to Asian Americans. Extending the range of Asian American critique, Immigrant Acts will interest readers concerned with race and ethnicity in the United States, American cultures, immigration, and transnationalism.",1996.0,4.0,272.0,197.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lane,History,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=otABiA17lNUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"Quito has always been one of the most enigmatic of colonial Spanish American cities. The history of its enormous hinterland, only a fraction of which forms the modern Republic of Ecuador, is even less known. This engaging book takes the watershed year 1599 as a starting point for a provocative reinterpretation of the history of Quito, city and colony. The result is a lively narrative that is also an original inquiry into the driving forces behind sixteenth-century Spanish colonialism. In six overlapping topical narratives Lane brings to life a place wracked by civil disturbances, shipwrecks, indigenous uprisings, pirate attacks, maroon intransigence, urban decadence, failed missionary endeavors, sharp economic reorientations, and wily and unpredictable subaltern adaptation and resistance. Drawing from a wealth of recent research on the colonial north Andes and on more than seven years of study in the archives of Ecuador, Colombia, and Spain, Lane presents rich discoveries of interest to economic historians, including a previously unknown gold boom; however, his primary interest is people. He explores the ways both individuals and groups--shipwreck victims, slaves, laborers, merchants, traders--faced obstacles and seized (or missed) opportunities, showing readers not only the basic facts and major themes of colonial life but also the influence and outcome of individual hopes and fears among people from a multitude of races and ethnicities.",2002.0,3.59,312.0,21.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3552945M/Quito_1599,/books/OL3552945M,292.0,"xix, 292 p. :",Kris Lane.,University of New Mexico Press,Albuquerque,2002,"[{'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'Social life and customs', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/social_life_and_customs'}, {'name': 'Race relations', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/race_relations'}, {'name': 'Economic conditions', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/economic_conditions'}, {'name': 'Quito (ecuador)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/quito_(ecuador)'}]","[{'name': 'Quito (Ecuador)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:quito_(ecuador)'}, {'name': 'Quito (Audiencia)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:quito_(audiencia)'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/quito1599citycol0000lane', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3552945M/Quito_1599/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]","['5886722', '38826']",['1125048'],"['0826323561', '082632357X']",['OL3552945M'],"['F3781.3 .L36 2002', 'F3781.3.L36 2002']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1571588-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1571588-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/1571588-L.jpg,city and colony in transition,Includes bibliographical references (p. 275-284) and index.,['2002004203'],,['986.6/13'],,,,"[{'name': '16th century', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/time:16th_century'}]",,,"[{'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': '""Castaways""', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': ""A Quito immigrant's letter to a relative in Spain"", 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': '""Captivity and redemption""', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': 'Native lords write to King Philip II', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': '""Tilling the center""', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': ""A miner-encomendero's last letter home"", 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': '""Mining the margins""', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': 'Prosperous settlers write home', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': '""Adventures in trade""', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': 'An anonymous description of Guayaquil', 'pagenum': ''}, {'level': 0, 'label': '', 'title': '""Pirates, soldiers, cannibals.""', 'pagenum': ''}]",,,,,,

The five years he spent in the Algerian bagnios or prison-houses (1575-1580) made an indelible impression on his works. From the first plays and narratives written after his release to his posthumous novel, the story of Cervantes's traumatic experience continuously speaks through his writings. Cervantes in Algiers offers a comprehensive view of his life as a slave and, particularly, of the lingering effects this traumatic experience had on his literary production. No work has documented in such vivid and illuminating detail the socio-political world of sixteenth-century Algiers, Cervantes's life in the prison-house, his four escape attempts, and the conditions of his final ransom. Garces's portrait of a sophisticated multi-ethnic culture in Algiers, moreover, is likely to open up new discussions about early modern encounters between Christians and Muslims. By bringing together evidence from many different sources, historical and literary, Garces reconstructs the relations between Christians, Muslims, and renegades in a number of Cervantes's writings. The idea that survivors of captivity need to repeat their story in order to survive (an insight invoked from Coleridge to Primo Levi to Dori Laub) explains not only Cervantes's storytelling but also the book that theorizes it so compellingly. As a former captive herself (a hostage of Colombian guerrillas), the author reads and listens to Cervantes with another ear.",2005.0,3.14,368.0,7.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Calvin, the irascible little boy with the stuffed tiger who comes to life are a pair bound for trouble. Boring school lessons become occasions for death-defying alien air battles, speeding snow sled descents elicit philosophical discussions on the meaning of life, and Hobbe's natural inclination to pounce on his little friend wreaks havoc on Calvin's sense of security. Calvin's the kid we all wish we'd been. Sassy, imaginative, far more verbal than his parents can manage, Calvin is the quintessential bad boy -- and the boy we love to see. He terrorizes little Susie, offers ""Candid Opinions"" from a neighborhood stand, and questions his parents' authority. ""What assurance do I have that your parenting isn't screwing me up?"" he demands. Calvin and Hobbes manages to say what needs to be said about childhood and life: ""Eww, mud,"" says Calvin.

In this practice the spirit of prayer was regarded as of first importance and the best form of prayer, for living prayer is the characteristic of genuine spirituality. Yet prayer is also vocal and may therefore on occasions be written. Consequently in the Puritan tradition there are many written prayers and meditations which constitute an important corpus of inspiring devotional literature. From this source, Arthur Bennett has distilled the essence of many prayers and set out in modern form what he calls ""aspiration units, the several parts of which could become springboards for the individual's own prayer subjects."" - Back cover.",1975.0,4.53,223.0,8939.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Huxley was decades ahead of his time in his anticipation of the dangers modern culture was creating through explosive population increase, headlong technological advance, and militant nationalism, and he saw psychedelics as the greatest means at our disposal to ""remind adults that the real world is very different from the misshapen universe they have created for themselves by means of their culture-conditioned prejudices."" Much of Huxley's writings following his 1953 mescaline experiment can be seen as his attempt to reveal the power of these substances to awaken a sense of the sacred in people living in a technological society hostile to mystical revelations. Moksha, a Sanskrit word meaning ""liberation,"" is a collection of the prophetic and visionary writings of Aldous Huxley. It includes selections from his acclaimed novels Brave New World and Island, both of which envision societies centered around the use of psychedelics as stabilizing forces, as well as pieces from The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell, his famous works on consciousness expansion.",1999.0,4.17,304.0,382.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL31734M/Moksha,/books/OL31734M,280.0,"xvii, 280 p. :",edited by Michael Horowitz and Cynthia Palmer ; preface by Albert Hofmann ; foreword by Humphry Osmond ; introduction by Alexander Shulgin.,Park Street Press,"Rochester, VT",1999,"[{'name': 'Hallucinogenic drugs', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/hallucinogenic_drugs'}, {'name': 'Psychological aspects of Hallucinogenic drugs', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/psychological_aspects_of_hallucinogenic_drugs'}, {'name': 'Hallucinogenic drugs and religious experience', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/hallucinogenic_drugs_and_religious_experience'}, {'name': 'Collected works', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/collected_works'}, {'name': 'Psychological aspects', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/psychological_aspects'}, {'name': 'Visions', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/visions'}, {'name': 'English prose literature', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/english_prose_literature'}, {'name': 'Mysticism', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/mysticism'}, {'name': 'Drugs, social aspects', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/drugs,_social_aspects'}, {'name': 'Hallucinations and illusions', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/hallucinations_and_illusions'}, {'name': 'British and irish fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/british_and_irish_fiction_(fictional_works_by_one_author)'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/mokshaaldoushuxl0000huxl_j4q7', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL31734M/Moksha/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['5134'],['89407'],['0892817585'],['OL31734M'],"['BF209.H34 H88 1999', 'BF209.H34H88 1999']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/691466-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/691466-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/691466-L.jpg,Aldous Huxley's classic writings on psychedelics and the visionary experience,"Includes bibliographical references and index.

Perkins’ insider’s view leads him to crisis of conscience--to the realization that he must devote himself to work which will foster a world-wide awareness of the sanctity of indigenous peoples, their cultures, and their environments. Perkins’ books demonstrate how the age-old shamanic techniques of some of the world’s most primitive peoples have sparked a revolution in modern concepts about healing, the subconscious, and the powers each of us has to alter individual and communal reality. This groundbreaking book is John Perkins’s firsthand account of his experiences with the shamanic technique of psychonavigation--a method of traveling outside the body by means of visions and dream wanderings--and his encounters with the Shuar of the Amazon, the Quechua of the Andes, and the Bugis of Indonesia. Shuar shamans psychonavigate for the purposes of hunting and healing, while the Bugis, among the most renowned sailors of the world, use these techniques to navigate without the aid of charts and compasses. Perkins explains how these techniques work and how the people of these indigenous cultures psychonavigate to both distant physical destinations and sources of inner wisdom. Throughout history, psychonavigation has been practiced by highly creative minds such as Beethoven, Jung, and Einstein. Perkins’s riveting narrative takes us on a journey of personal discovery as he learns the great value of these techniques and their relevance not only to individual well-being, but to the health of the environment and of the world at large. He reveals how by attuning to the positive forces in nature and communicating with our inner guides we all can become psychonavigators, finding our way to wise decisions and developing innovative approaches to the challenges we face as individuals and a world community.",1999.0,4.19,144.0,59.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8233185M/Psychonavigation,/books/OL8233185M,144.0,,,Destiny Books,,"September 1, 1999","[{'name': 'Psychoanalysis', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/psychoanalysis'}]",,,['25431'],['596295'],['089281800X'],['OL8233185M'],,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/691496-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/691496-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/691496-L.jpg,Techniques for Travel Beyond Time,,,,,,,['9780892818006'],,,,,,,5.6 ounces,,,

As if caught in a time warp, Topsail resembles the resorts of decades past.

McAllister blends interviews with the people who know the island with stories of early pirates, devastating hurricanes, a 1940s dig in search of a 1630 Spanish galleon's treasure, the U.S. government's secret rocket program, a modern-day sea-turtle preservation project, and a black bear that came to stroll the beach.

Just as there is movement in Dante's epic, so there is movement in these books, from Ecclesiates to Job, from Job to Song of Songs.

The more he read, the more Alex came to the startling conclusion that the present day Catholic Church - and the Holy Mass - is the same exact worship service from the very early Church. Alex began to share his findings with his parish, and eventually Alex, and most of his parish, joined the Catholic Church. This is his incredible story of a black Penecostal minister's challenging and dramatic spiritual jounrey, and the flock that followed him.

In this Annual Gandhi Lecture for the International Association of Gandhian Studies, Mark Shepard tackles some persistently wrong-headed views of Gandhi, offering us a more accurate picture of the man and his nonviolence. ///////////////////////////////////////////////// Mark Shepard is the author of ""Mahatma Gandhi and His Myths,"" ""The Community of the Ark,"" and ""Gandhi Today,"" called by the American Library Association's Booklist ""a masterpiece of committed reporting.""

It would be [some] of the most valuable pages many people could read about Gandhi."" -- Global Conscience, July-Sept. 1990 ///////////////////////////////////////////////// SAMPLE I suspect that most of the myths and misconceptions surrounding Gandhi have to do with nonviolence. For instance, it's surprising how many people still have the idea that nonviolent action is passive. It's important for us to be clear about this: There is nothing passive about Gandhian nonviolent action. I'm afraid Gandhi himself helped create this confusion by referring to his method at first as ""passive resistance,"" because it was in some ways like techniques bearing that label. But he soon changed his mind and rejected the term. Gandhi's nonviolent action was not an evasive strategy nor a defensive one. Gandhi was always on the offensive. He believed in confronting his opponents aggressively, in such a way that they could not avoid dealing with him. But wasn't Gandhi's nonviolent action designed to avoid violence? Yes and no. Gandhi steadfastly avoided violence toward his opponents. He did not avoid violence toward himself or his followers. Gandhi said that the nonviolent activist, like any soldier, had to be ready to die for the cause. And in fact, during India's struggle for independence, hundreds of Indians were killed by the British. The difference was that the nonviolent activist, while willing to die, was never willing to kill. Gandhi pointed out three possible responses to oppression and injustice. One he described as the coward's way: to accept the wrong or run away from it. The second option was to stand and fight by force of arms. Gandhi said this was better than acceptance or running away. But the third way, he said, was best of all and required the most courage: to stand and fight solely by nonviolent means.",2002.0,3.64,46.0,55.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8416921M/Mahatma_Gandhi_and_His_Myths,/books/OL8416921M,42.0,,,Shepard Publications,,"January 1, 2002",,,,['2236'],['619464'],['0938497197'],['OL8416921M'],,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/716218-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/716218-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/716218-L.jpg,"Civil Disobedience, Nonviolence, and Satyagraha in the Real World (Plus Why It's ""Gandhi,"" Not ""Ghandi"")",,,,,,,['9780938497196'],,,,,,,2.1 ounces,,,

Florizel steamed out of St. John's harbour, bound for Halifax and New York. Captain William Martin, a cautious and competent skipper, encountered thick ice and heavy winds as he headed down the treacherous Newfoundland coast. But these circumstances did not account for the ship's slow speed. Just before dawn, over nine hours after leaving port, Captain Martin ran his ship full steam onto the rocks just north of Cape Race. But that was only the beginning of a long and gruelling drama. As the ship slowly disintegrated, the passengers and crew desperately tried to save themselves. Men, women, and children were washed overboard, or killed from exposure, or fatally trapped below deck. From the shore helpless fishermen watched in horror. Twenty-seven hours after striking the reef the daring rescue took place. Of the 138 on board, seventeen passengers and twenty-seven crew members survived. In A Winter's Tale Cassie Brown retells in chilling detail the story of the wreck, the rescue, and the enquiry that followed.

Julius Caesar himself was one of the most eminent writers of the age in which he lived. His commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are written with a purity, precision, and perspicuity, which command approbation. They are elegant without affectation, and beautiful without ornament. Of the two books which he composed on Analogy, and those under the title of Anti-Cato, scarcely any fragment is preserved; but we may be assured of the justness of the observations on language, which were made by an author so much distinguished by the excellence of his own compositions. His poem entitled The Journey, which was probably an entertaining narrative, is likewise totally lost. All of Caesar's works that remain intact are contained in this edition of his commentaries. It is to the honor of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic. His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister. Caesar deprecated a lingering death, and wished that his own might be sudden and speedy. And the day before he died, the conversation at supper, in the house of Marcus Lepidus, turning upon what wasthe most eligible way of dying, he gave his opinion in favor of a death that is sudden and unexpected.

A full Rails application probably has less total code than the XML you'd need to configure the same application in other frameworks. With this book you'll learn how to use ActiveRecord to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. You'll learn how to use the Action Pack framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There are extensive chapters on testing, deployment, and scaling. You'll see how easy it is to install Rails using your web server of choice (such as Apache or lighttpd) or using its own included web server. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all. You'll create a complete online store application in the extended tutorial section, so you'll see how a full Rails application is developed---iteratively and rapidly. Rails strives to honor the Pragmatic Programmer's ""DRY Principle"" by avoiding the extra work of configuration files and code annotations. You can develop in real-time: make a change, and watch it work immediately. Forget XML. Everything in Rails, from templates to control flow to business logic, is written in Ruby, the language of choice for programmers who like to get the job done well (and leave work on time for a change).

The difference in their perspectives, where faith and reason seem to diverge, forms the underlying tension that propels the storyline. When an unlikely sequence of fortune and misfortune seems divinely influenced and leads them to interpret events differently, it produces conflicting judgments on how to react, and their friendship is put to the test. Counteracting the wedge that pushes them apart is the human drive to grasp the spiritual meaning of existence. Because it is not enough to agree to disagree, each is driven to bring the other to his view in order to affirm that it represents truth. Their actions are influenced not by a God who intervenes in the matters of mankind, but by belief of whether or not He does. Ultimately they discover that a man is defined by his actions and not by what he believes to be true. Morality exists to guide actions, not thoughts. The story of Tom Dagney and Christopher Pierce represents the struggle between belief and non-belief within men who, by their very nature, doubt that which they profess to believe, and struggle to understand this dichotomy. How belief translates into behavior proves far more intriguing than scholarly debate about philosophical perspectives. Caring about what people think pales compared to the passions aroused by how they live. This story of friendship, love, envy, tragedy, and redemption gives breath to philosophy and life to the struggle to identify human purpose. Above all Secular Faith exemplifies that, without a doubt, a man who puts aside his faith to serve his friends will always be a better man than one who puts aside his friends to serve his faith.",2003.0,3.6,600.0,52.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet the lives they created for themselves through years of hard work vanished almost instantly after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. David Neiwert combines compelling story-telling with first-hand interviews and newly uncovered documents to weave together the history of this community and the racist schemes that prevented the immigrants from reclaiming their land after the war. Ultimately, Strawberry Days represents more than one community's story, reminding us that bigotry's roots are deeply entwined in the very fiber of American society.",2005.0,3.97,288.0,55.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President Harrison E. Livingstone's major new book, the fifth of his works on the death of JFK, brings together for the first time all of the central evidence demonstrating a domestic Right Wing conspiracy rooted in Texas which assassinated the President on November 22, 1963. The book represents forty years of work. The book discusses in great detail the actual medical evidence and the forgery of the autopsy photographs and X-rays, which Mr. Livingstone first exposed, the alteration of the autopsy report, the framing of the designated patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and the substitution and fabrication of every single piece of evidence. It discusses the role played in the murder by some of the most powerful men in the country: Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, and Richard Nixon, as well as the rich oil men and companies who backed them. It then describes the cover-ups by the media, the major investigations over the years, the FBI, and the mind-control cooperation at work in the case to misdirect researchers and the public. The book describes in great detail the people and companies in Texas who planned and carried out the assassination. It names names. One recent investigation in the 90s followed Mr. Livingstone's preceeding work and reinvestigated with the witnesses both he and the official investigations had talked to, but this time took into consideration their documentation and what they had actually said, and in a chapter this is his stunning new evidence from the U.S. government under President Clinton that is blowing the lid off the case. Mr. Livingstone first revealed to the Washington press corps in 1998 that there has been such a secret investigation, and spoke for fifty minutes when the Assassination Records Review Board gave their final press conference. As a result, Mr. Livingstone was on all major TV networks and on the ""Today"" show (NBC) with Katie Couric the next morning. The book also contains the story of Dallas doctor Charles Crenshaw's law suit and the depositions of the editor and writer of the Journal of American Medical Association who libeled him in articles in 1992. Dr. Crenshaw's book about trying to save Kennedy at Parkland Hospital shortly after the shooting came out on the same day as Mr. Livingstone's major work on the medical evidence, High Treason 2, were JAMA's targets, and the depositions contain much discussion of Mr. Livingstone's major impact on the JFK case.

The journey from sexual curiosity to finally coming out can be confusing without proper guidance and empowering role models. In Same Sex in the City, Lauren Levin and Lauren Blitzer provide women -- gay, straight, and bi-curious alike -- with firsthand insight into the advantages and challenges of being a lesbian. In prose that is at once honest and uplifting, the Laurens relate their own experiences and those of the women they interview, as well as offer serious advice, titillating anecdotes, and a positive attitude for girls who know they're gay -- and for those who are wondering about their sexuality but are not yet sure whether their Prince Charming is really a Cinderella. Part confessional, part informational, Same Sex in the City covers the gamut of lesbian life -- from dating to heartbreak, and from hooking up with straight chicks to raising a family. It's the book that millions of women have been searching for -- a relationship guide that will help every woman come to terms with and celebrate her sexuality, whatever it may be.",2006.0,3.58,250.0,385.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It’s the best relationship advice you’ll ever receive. For ages, women have come together over coffee, cocktails, or late-night phone chats to analyze the puzzling behavior of men. He’s afraid to get hurt again. Maybe he doesn’t want to ruin the friendship. Maybe he’s intimidated by me. He just got out of a relationship. Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo are here to say that—despite good intentions—you’re wasting your time. Men are not complicated, although they’d like you to think they are. And there are no mixed messages. The truth may be, He’s just not that into you. Unfortunately, guys are too terrified to ever directly tell a woman, “You're not the one.” But their actions absolutely show how they feel. Reexamining familiar scenarios and classic mindsets that keep us in unsatisfying relationships, Behrendt and Tuccillo’s wise and wry understanding of the sexes spares women hours of waiting by the phone, obsessing over the details with sympathetic girlfriends, and hoping his mixed messages really mean, “I’m in love with you and want to be with you.” He’s Just Not That Into You is provocative, hilarious, and, above all, intoxicatingly liberating. It deserves a place on every woman’s night table. It knows you’re a beautiful, smart, funny woman who deserves better. The next time you feel the need to start “figuring him out,” consider the glorious thought that maybe, He’s just not that into you. And then set yourself loose to go find the one who is. This NEWLY EXPANDED EDITION includes: a new foreword from Greg Behrendt; a new chapter—providing an honest look at the stages of life after He's Just Not That Into You, according to Liz, including exaltation, loneliness, temptation, and balance; and Greg and Liz address the most frequently asked reader questions.",2006.0,3.66,208.0,51316.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In her essay ""Writing and Film,"" the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Jhumpa Lahiri writes about the experience of seeing her novel ""transposed"" from paper to film. ""Its essence remains, but it inhabits a different realm and must, like a transposed piece of music, conform to a different set of rules. . . . To have someone as devoted and as gifted as Mira reinvent my novel . . . has been a humbling and thrilling passage."" Mira Nair's essay, ""Photographs as Inspiration,"" begins with the provocative comment: ""If it weren't for photography, I wouldn't be a filmmaker."" She explains how photographs help her crystallize the visual style of her films and which particular photos influenced her vision for The Namesake. These two essays, written exclusively for this Newmarket Pictorial Moviebook, introduce an amazing panoply of images of people and places shot mainly in New York and Calcutta during the making of the movie, accented by excerpts from Lahiri's bestselling novel. Six Indian and American photographers' works are represented. Brilliantly illuminating the immigrant experience and the tangled ties between generations, The Namesake tells the story of the Ganguli family, whose move from Calcutta to New York evokes a lifelong balancing act to adapt to a new world while remembering the old. The couple's firstborn, Gogol, and sister Sonia grow up amid these divided loyalties, struggling to find their own identity without losing their heritage.

Marine Conservation Biology Institute,Nature,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=bK9LmAEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"Humans are terrestrial animals, and our capacity to see and understand the importance and vulnerability of life in the sea has trailed our growing ability to harm it. While conservation biologists are working to address environmental problems humans have created on land, loss of marine biodiversity, including extinctions and habitat degradation, has received much less attention. At the same time, marine sciences such as oceanography and fisheries biology have largely ignored issues of conservation. Marine Conservation Biology brings together for the first time in a single volume leading experts from around the world to apply the lessons and thinking of conservation biology to marine issues. Contributors including James M. Acheson, Louis W. Botsford, James T. Carlton, Kristina Gjerde, Selina S. Heppell, Ransom A. Myers, Julia K. Parrish, Stephen R. Palumbi, and Daniel Pauly offer penetrating insights on the nature of marine biodiversity, what threatens it, and what humans can and must do to recover the biological integrity of the world's estuaries, coastal seas, and oceans. Sections examine: distinctive aspects of marine populations and ecosystems; threats to marine biological diversity, singly and in combination; place-based management of marine ecosystems; the often-neglected human dimensions of marine conservation. Marine Conservation Biology breaks new ground by creating the conceptual framework for the new field of marine conservation biology -- the science of protecting, recovering, and sustainably using the living sea. It synthesizes the latest knowledge and ideas from leading thinkers in disciplines ranging from larval biology to sociology, making it a must-read for research and teaching faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate and advanced undergraduate students (who share an interest in bringing conservation biology to marine issues). Likewise, its lucid scientific examinations illuminate key issues facing environmental managers, policymakers, advocates, and funders concerned with the health of our oceans.",2005.0,4.67,496.0,14.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Desperate Living is a perverse fairy tale featuring gun-toting lesbians, leather-clad castle guards, and a repulsive queen who has her own daughter gang-raped among other atrocities.

Their wide-ranging discussions take place over the course of a year, beginning in July 2004. Set against the backdrop of George W. Bush's re-election campaign and the war in Iraq, each considers what it means to live in America today. John asks his father to look back to World War II, and explore the parallels that can—and cannot—be drawn between that time and our current post-9/11 consciousness. As their conversations develop, the topics shift from the political to the personal to the political again, as they duck and weave around one another.

And what starts out as what could be a too-cute literary trick winds up being extremely revealing, as the characters pour themselves into the letters, regardless of whom they're writing to, as the plot skips and slips through time. On one level it acts as a sequel to those early novels, continuing their stories and although it's not really required to read those books, I'm not going to pretend it doesn't help. The best thing to do would be to read those old novels in one block and then move onto this ... I read them some years ago so I was a little fuzzy on the finer points. But I picked it up. But Barth captures the voices of his old characters well and even if you didn't know who was writing what letter, you could tell. And thus they tell the recepient, and us, about their hopes and fears, they mingle together, they lie, they come unglued, and by the end you sort of get a tapestry of their thoughts. There's a plot weaving through here but sometimes it becomes hard to connect it with six different people discussing different angles of it with you, but I just went with it and enjoyed the writing for what it was. --Michael Battaglia at Amazon.com.",1994.0,3.82,772.0,202.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL1084917M/Letters,/books/OL1084917M,772.0,"xix, 772 p. ;",John Barth.,Dalkey Archive Press,"Normal, IL",1994,"[{'name': 'Imaginary letters', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/imaginary_letters'}, {'name': 'American fiction (fictional works by one author)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/american_fiction_(fictional_works_by_one_author)'}]",,,['24842'],['123841'],['1564780619'],['OL1084917M'],"['PS3552.A75 L4 1994', 'PS3552.A75L4 1994']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/801460-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/801460-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/801460-L.jpg,a novel,,['94008761'],,['813/.54'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Against the steady flow of stories highlighting ""mainline decline,"" The Practicing Congregation suggested that there is a new and often overlooked renaissance occurring in mainline Protestant churches. The success of The Practicing Congregation made it clear that the next step was to provide examples that would illustrate the concepts laid out in that initial work. In From Nomads to Pilgrims, the editors continue to build this narrative, gathering specific stories of congregational vitality and transformation from participants in their research at the Project on Congregations of Intentional Practice, a Lilly Endowment Inc. funded study at Virginia Theological Seminary. Including stories from a variety of faith traditions across the U.S., From Nomads to Pilgrims explores: how intentional congregations develop; how they negotiate the demands of interpreting traditional Christian practices in a postmodern culture; how these practices lead to congregational and personal transformation. Each chapter is an instructive case study, illustrating a unique expression of the vitality experienced by a congregation that intentionally reclaims a traditional Christian practice. The pastors who have been involved in these congregations stories share their practical wisdom gained through the experience of leading these churches. - how intentional congregations develop - how they negotiate the demands of interpreting traditional Christian practices in a postmodern culture - how these practices lead to congregational and personal transformation.""",2005.0,4.0,179.0,13.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For more than seventeen years, he was a researcher and remote viewer for the top-secret Army project STARGATE. For years after that, he journeyed through time while working in a consciousness-development lab with out-of-body experience pioneer Robert A. Monroe. McMoneagle explores the questions that philosophers have for centuries debated: Does time really exist? Do our actions today really affect our future? Can we change the past? Do we slip between alternate realities? In The Ultimate Time Machine, McMoneagle delivers new insights into these mysteries, including: First-hand information--including transcripts from lab sessions--on the origins of humanity, the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and the building of the Egyptian pyramids. Provocative suggestions about the nature of time, creation, and a constantly changing past. A detailed picture of our immediate future through the year 2075.

When it became a surprise blockbuster, studios began to trust him with larger budgets and the whims of his expansive imagination. Mixing gothic horror, black comedy, and oddball whimsy, Burton's movies veer from childlike enchantment to morbid melancholy, often with the same frame. His beautifully designed and highly stylized films-including Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, and Ed Wood-are idiosyncratic, personal visions that have found commercial success. In Tim Burton: Interviews, the director discusses how animation and art design affect his work, how old horror films have deeply influenced his psyche, why so many of his protagonists are outcasts, and how he's managed to make personal films within the Hollywood system. He gives tribute to writers he's worked with, his favorite actors-including Johnny Depp and Vincent Price-and talks enthusiastically about pulp horror fiction and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. These interviews show his progression from an inarticulate young director to a contemplative and dry-witted artist over the course of twenty years. In later interviews, he opens up about being in therapy and how his childhood fantasies still affect his art. Tim Burton: Interviews reveals a man who has managed to thrive inside Hollywood while maintaining the distinctive quirks of an independent filmmaker. Kristian Fraga, New York City, wrote and directed the award-winning PBS documentary The Inside Reel: Digital Filmmaking.

For guiding the Nine through one of the most tumultuous civil rights crises of the 1950s, she was selected as Woman of the Year in Education by the Associated Press in 1957 and was the only woman invited to speak at the Lincoln Memorial ceremony in the March on Washington in 1963. But her importance as a historical figure has been overlooked by scholars of the civil rights movement. Daisy Bates: Civil Rights Crusader from Arkansas chronicles her life and political advocacy before, during, and well after the Central High School crisis. An orphan from the Arkansas mill town of Huttig, she eventually rose to the zenith of civil rights action. In 1952, she was elected president of the NAACP in Arkansas and traveled the country speaking on political issues. During the 1960s, she worked as a field organizer for presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson to get out the black vote. Even after a series of strokes, she continued to orchestrate self-help and economic initiatives in Arkansas. Using interviews, archival records, contemporary news-paper accounts, and other materials, author Grif Stockley reconstructs Bates's life and career, revealing her to be a complex, contrary leader of the civil rights movement. Ultimately, Daisy Bates paints a vivid portrait of an ardent, overlooked advocate of social justice.",2005.0,3.55,340.0,11.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3397177M/Daisy_Bates,/books/OL3397177M,340.0,"vii, 340 p. ;",Grif Stockley.,University Press of Mississippi,Jackson,2005,"[{'name': 'African American women civil rights workers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/african_american_women_civil_rights_workers'}, {'name': 'African Americans', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/african_americans'}, {'name': 'Biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/biography'}, {'name': 'Central High School (Little Rock, Ark.)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/central_high_school_(little_rock,_ark.)'}, {'name': 'Civil rights movements', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/civil_rights_movements'}, {'name': 'Civil rights workers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/civil_rights_workers'}, {'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'Race relations', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/race_relations'}, {'name': 'School integration', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/school_integration'}, {'name': 'United states, race relations', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/united_states,_race_relations'}, {'name': 'Little rock (ark.)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/little_rock_(ark.)'}, {'name': 'Arkansas, biography', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/arkansas,_biography'}, {'name': 'Civil rights movements, united states', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/civil_rights_movements,_united_states'}, {'name': 'African americans, arkansas', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/african_americans,_arkansas'}, {'name': 'Bates, daisy, 1860-1951', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/bates,_daisy,_1860-1951'}, {'name': 'African americans, civil rights', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/african_americans,_civil_rights'}, {'name': 'Arkansas, history', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/arkansas,_history'}]","[{'name': 'Arkansas', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:arkansas'}, {'name': 'Little Rock', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:little_rock'}, {'name': 'Little Rock (Ark.)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:little_rock_(ark.)'}]","[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/daisybatescivilr00stoc', 'availability': 'restricted', 'formats': {}}]",['20164'],['2275517'],['1578068010'],['OL3397177M'],"['F419.L7 S76 2005', 'F419.L7S76 2005']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/834203-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/834203-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/834203-L.jpg,civil rights crusader from Arkansas,Includes bibliographical references (p. 298-334) and index.,['2005009959'],['59403468'],"['323/.092', 'B']",Daisy Bates,,,,,,,,,,,,

John Adams had a tankard of cider every morning at breakfast. After a long day on safari, Ernest Hemingway liked to kick back beside the campfire with a glass of cider. And Robert Frost saluted his favorite beverage with a poem titled ?In A Glass of Cider.? Neck and neck with brewing beer at home is the resurgence of making cider. Whether sweet, hard, blended, or sparkling, trend watchers say cider, once the preferred beverage of early America, could very well become the drink of the future. (Hard cider is the fastest growing segment of the beverage industry.) Keeping pace with the commercial cider producers are small-scale and individual cider makers who have discovered how easy it is to make their own. After all, the only ingredient you need is an apple. In this updated edition of Cider, Annie Proulx and Lew Nichols take you step-by-step through the process that renders fruit into a refreshing drink. In addition to learning about the equipment you?ll need to make a glorious cider, Proulx and Nichols also discuss the pros and cons of various types of apple presses ? from traditional heavy grinders to sleek hydraulic presses. You?ll also learn about the glass bottles vs. wooden barrels debate; how to filter, fine, and rack your cider; and where and how to store it. Proulx and Nichols provide detailed recipes for making six types of cider: still, sparkling, champagne, barrel, French, and flavored, with advice on which apples to use to achieve a tart, aromatic, astringent, or neutral quality in your cider. In fact, this book is brimming with expert advice on cidermaking. If you want to plant your own apple orchard, this book has an entire chapter that lists which cultivars of apples thrive in which parts of the United States and Canada, along with each cultivar?s characteristics and when it is ready for harvesting. Another chapter explains how to care for an orchard, from improving the soil to pruning and thinning the trees to fighting off pests and wildlife. Once a cidermaker has learned how to make excellent cider, he or she is likely to look for further fields t o explore. With that in mind, the authors include a chapter on making cider vinegars and brandy and using cider in cooking. Finally, Proulx and Nichols walk you through the latest federal regulations covering the production and sale of homemade cider in the United States and Canada, and they familiarize you with the kind of impact state and provincial laws can make.The clear, simple language, numerous illustrations, and detailed step-by-step directions make it easy for even novices to become skilled cidermakers. This revised edition of the classic handbook is a complete guide for anyone who wants to discover the pleasure of making ? and drinking ? fresh cider.",2003.0,3.64,224.0,175.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The suffering was unsurpassed, but the whole message of the Bible leads to this answer. Why did Christ suffer and die? The central issue of Jesus' death is not the cause, but the meaning-God's meaning. That is what this book is about. John Piper has gathered from the New Testament fifty reasons.

9781581346527,1581346522,When I Don't Desire God,How to Fight for Joy,John Piper,Religion,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=vtQgLN0Aq8YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"For over twenty-five years John Piper has trumpeted the truth that “God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him.” He calls it Christian Hedonism. The problem is that many people, after being persuaded, find that this truth is both liberating and devastating. It’s liberating because it endorses our inborn desire for joy. And it’s devastating because it reveals that we don’t desire God the way we should. What do you do when you discover the good news that God wants you to be content in him, but then find that you aren’t? If joy in God were merely the icing on the cake of Christian commitment, this book would be insignificant. But Piper argues that joy is so much more. Our being satisfied in God is necessary to show God’s worthiness and to sustain sacrifices of love. Jesus endured the cross for the joy that was set before him. He tasted it. It sustained him through the deepest suffering. His Father was glorified. His people were saved. That is what joy in God does. The absolutely urgent question becomes: What can I do if I don’t have it? With a pastor’s heart and with radical passion for the glory of Christ, John Piper helps you answer that question.",2004.0,4.18,268.0,4131.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8783161M/When_I_Don't_Desire_God,/books/OL8783161M,272.0,,,Crossway Books,,"September 21, 2004","[{'name': 'Praise of God', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/praise_of_god'}, {'name': 'God (Christianity)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/god_(christianity)'}, {'name': 'Desire for God', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/desire_for_god'}, {'name': 'Worship and love', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/worship_and_love'}, {'name': 'Happiness', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/happiness'}, {'name': 'Christianity', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/christianity'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/whenidontdesireg00pipe', 'availability': 'restricted', 'formats': {}}]",['45352'],['23468'],['1581346522'],['OL8783161M'],['BV4817 .P57 2004'],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/842215-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/842215-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/842215-L.jpg,How to Fight For Joy,,['2004016323'],['55960838'],,,Christian Hedonism is a liberating and devastating doctrine.,['9781581346527'],,,,,,,10.4 ounces,,,

They had come to witness the passing of their beloved Amulet from one Guardian to the next, as well as the fulfilling of the ancient prophecy that would unite the two great powers of their land. But instead, betrayal and subterfuge plunged their world into chaos. The Amulet, (a powerful talisman that holds most of their world's magic) is sentenced to fifty years of silence, and worse, helplessness. The talisman is secreted away, hidden from the treacherous Queen whose one desire is to claim its powers as her own. For fifty years the power of the Amulet is trapped within the golden walls of its domain, waiting for the time when it can summon the next young woman who will serve as Guardian and wield its power. Jessica Spencer cannot explain the recurring dream that beckons to her. Every morning the message of the dream is lost leaving her with an aching desire to fulfill a fate she cannot even remember. Fifty years later, they gather once again in the Ring of Challenge, hoping to see an end to the reign of terror that began with the silencing of the Amulet half a century ago. The High Queen, who desires nothing more than to weild the power herself, the fair-haired child who is slowly realizing the fate her dreams have only hinted at, their Protector and Champion come together in the Ring of Challenge to once again decide the destiny of the Scerone.

He finds someone whose temperament was often at war with his upbringing. The son of an army officer, educated at Eton and Oxford, Powell chose as his closest friends people like Malcolm Muggeridge and the composer Constant Lambert, who were not out of the top drawer, or the one below it. Although happily married for more than sixty years to Lady Violet Pakenham, the daughter of an earl, he admitted that he had always been attracted by girls who looked as if they'd slept under a bush for a week. Powell believed that creative writing was, like alchemy, a mysterious, indefinable process by which experience became art. Michael Barber focuses on the experience that provided Powell with his raw material. He pays particular attention to the entre-deux-guerres, that sharply divided cultural interlude when the artists and good-timers with whom Powell identified in the twenties were followed, in the thirties, by the politicians and the prigs.

A Turkish territory until 1912, the city was an economic centre of the Ottoman empire and a cultural centre of Sephardic Judaism. In this memoir, Leon Sciaky, the son of a Sephardic merchant family who immigrated to Turkey during the Spanish Inquisition, tells of growing up in the vibrant community that flourished in Salonica at the turn of the century. He introduces the Turkish sheiks and dervishes, Sephardic rabbis, Hungarian revolutionaries, Bulgarian farmers, Greek priests, Kurdish grocers, Albanian woodcutters, and French headmasters who populated this little Balkan world. Although his early years were idyllic, Sciaky's well-respected merchant family could not escape the violence of Salonica's constant lesions and struggles. Situated amidst peoples of different languages, religions, cultures, and national allegiances, Salonica was like a vividly set stage in a drama where these very diverse peoples lived, in peace and strife, vying for power and prosperity.",2003.0,4.11,299.0,62.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8844554M/Farewell_to_Salonica,/books/OL8844554M,288.0,,,"Paul Dry Books, Inc.",,"May 1, 2003","[{'name': 'History', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/history'}, {'name': 'Social life and customs', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/social_life_and_customs'}, {'name': 'Greece, social life and customs', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/greece,_social_life_and_customs'}, {'name': 'Turkey, history', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/turkey,_history'}, {'name': 'Ethnic relations', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/ethnic_relations'}, {'name': 'Sephardim', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/sephardim'}, {'name': 'Jews', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/jews'}, {'name': 'Kind', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/kind'}]","[{'name': 'Saloniki', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:saloniki'}, {'name': 'Thessalonikē (Greece)', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:thessalonikē_(greece)'}, {'name': 'Turkey', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/place:turkey'}]",,['14492'],['1116442'],['1589880021'],['OL8844554M'],"['DR432.S34 2003', 'DR432 .S34 2003']",https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/858591-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/858591-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/858591-L.jpg,City at the Crossroads,,['2003007214'],['51942676'],,,,['9781589880023'],,,,,,,14.4 ounces,,,

In a work that is in various degrees biography, criticism, and sheer poetry, Simic tells the story of Cornell’s life and illuminates the hermetic mysteries of his extraordinary boxes–objects in which private obsessions were alchemically transformed into enduring works of art. Simic sees Cornell’s work as exemplifying a distinctively American aesthetic, open to the world, improvisatory, at once homemade and universal, modest and teasing and profound. Full of unexpected riches, Dime-Store Alchemy is both an entrancing meditation on the nature of art and a perfect introduction to a major American artist by one of his peers–a book that can be perused at length or dipped into at leisure again and again.",2006.0,4.21,116.0,69.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More than a million Muslim Algerians died in the conflict and as many European settlers were driven into exile. Above all, the war was marked by an unholy marriage of revolutionary terror and state torture. The war made headlines around the world, and at the time it seemed like a French affair: Now, this brutal and intractable conflict looks less like the last colonial war than the first postmodern one--a full-dress rehearsal for the sort of amorphous struggle that convulsed the Balkans in the 1990s and that is now ravaging Iraq, and in which religion, nationalism, imperialism, and terrorism assume previously unimagined degrees of intensity.",2006.0,4.22,608.0,1811.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We're always thinking, ""Life isn't the way it should be - and it's my fault!"" But, Huber explains, no amount of self-punishment will ever make us happy or bring us control over life's problems. The happiness and peace we are looking for is ultimately found only in self-acceptance and kindness.

Unlike traditional occupations such as accounting or administration, the software business is populated with programmers who are as creative and passionate about their work as musicians and artists. But for most programmers and project managers, it is a complete surprise when they enter the business world and find that internal politics, inept management, and unrealistic marketing drive the process, rather than a structured and orderly approach based on technical issues and quality. This guide, delivered with the wit and aplomb to make a serious topic entertaining and palatable, will help you survive the programming industry. The Career Programmer explains how you can work within the existing system to solve deadline problems and regain control of the development process. Youll master self-defense techniques to shield yourself, your project, and your code from corporate politics, arbitrary management decisions, and marketing-driven deadlines. Author Chris Duncan provides proven, practical, hands-on solutions designed to work even when tested by the political and chaotic realities of the business environment. Issues are addressed from the points of view of both the programmer and project manager, and steps are illustrated from all perspectivesfrom large-scale teams down to projects with a single developer. For you, the end results will mean less overtime and stress, higher-quality software, and a more satisfying career.",2006.0,3.13,264.0,36.0,High Rating,15300.78,https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8848855M/The_Career_Programmer,/books/OL8848855M,264.0,,,Apress,,"January 25, 2006","[{'name': 'Development', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/development'}, {'name': 'Management', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/management'}, {'name': 'Vocational guidance', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/vocational_guidance'}, {'name': 'Electronic data processing', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/electronic_data_processing'}, {'name': 'Computer programmers', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/computer_programmers'}, {'name': 'Project management', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/project_management'}, {'name': 'Computer software', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/computer_software'}, {'name': 'Computer programming', 'url': 'https://openlibrary.org/subjects/computer_programming'}]",,"[{'preview_url': 'https://archive.org/details/careerprogrammer00chri', 'availability': 'borrow', 'formats': {}, 'borrow_url': 'https://openlibrary.org/books/OL8848855M/The_Career_Programmer/borrow', 'checkedout': False}]",['5843'],['188129'],['1590596242'],['OL8848855M'],['QA76.76.C65'],https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/861528-S.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/861528-M.jpg,https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/861528-L.jpg,"Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World, Second Edition (Expert's Voice)",,,,,,,['9781590596241'],,,,,,,13.6 ounces,,,

Based on twenty-five years of experience advising and observing a range of companies, Stalk and Lachenauer reveal how hardball competitors achieve decisive victories - without bending the law and without compromising their obligations to customers and stakeholders. These companies often play rough, and they don't apologize for it. Yet they are also extraordinarily adept at the ""soft"" side of management - rallying talent and building culture through a laserlike focus on the few issues most critical to success. Using detailed and engaging stories from many industries, Hardball outlines seven classic hardball strategies: unleash massive and overwhelming force, exploit anomalies, threaten competitors' profit sanctuaries, take it and make it your own, entice competitors' into retreat, break industry compromises, and hardball M&A. The authors reveal who uses hardball strategies, under what circumstances each strategy is most effective, and how to orchestrate the attack.",2004.0,3.49,192.0,82.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brunner claims that the task of that generation was to find a way back to a legitimate natural theology. Barth responds strongly, arguing that there is no way to knowledge of God by way of human reason.

'Tom Jones' is widely regarded as one of the first and most influential English novels. It is certainly the funniest. Tom Jones, the hero of the book, is introduced to the reader as the ward of a liberal Somerset squire. Tom is a generous but slightly wild and feckless country boy with a weakness for young women. Misfortune, followed by many spirited adventures as he travels to London to seek his fortune, teach him a sort of wisdom to go with his essential good-heartedness. This 'comic, epic poem in prose' will make the modern reader laugh as much as it did his forbears. Its biting satire finds an echo in today's society, for as Doris Lessing recently remarked ""This country becomes every day more like the eighteenth century, full of thieves and adventurers, rogues and a robust, unhypocritical savagery side-by-side with people lecturing others on morality"". AUTHOR: Henry Fielding (1707-1754) was an English novelist; building on the foundations put in place by Daniel Defoe and others, he was a major contributor to the form of the modern novel. He wrote four novels, of which the most enduring is 'The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling', widely regarded as among the finest books ever written.",1992.0,3.74,734.0,555.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This book describes how, having smashed one of the two main Catholic armies, he faced the other at Lützen near Leipzig in November 1632. In a nightmare battle fought in thick fog, his Swedish troops locked horns with the Imperial army.

A celebrated aristocratic beauty, Jane Digby married Lord Ellenborough at 17. Their divorce a few years later was one of England's most scandalous at that time. In her quest for passionate fulfillment she had lovers which included an Austrian prince, King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and a Greek count whose infidelities drove her to travel Eastern Asia. In Syria, she found the love of her life, a Bedouin nobleman, Sheikh Medjuel el Mezrab, who was 20 years her junior. During the remainder of her life she adopted for six months of each year the exotic but uniquely harsh existence of a desert nomad living in the famous black goathair tents of Arabia; the remaining months she spent in the splendid palace she built for herself and Medjuel in Damascus. As wife to the Sheikh and mother to his tribe this passionate woman found not only genuine fulfillment but further adventures, all of which she committed each year to her diary.",1996.0,4.03,365.0,819.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1998 he won the John Kobal Photographic Portrait Award for A Woman Reading a Possession Order, a beautifully crafted photograph based on a composition by the Dutch master, Johannes Vermeer (1632–1675). Featuring selections of the bold images that established Hunter’s reputation, together with new work, this book conveys the artist’s deep concern with depicting the lives of the residents of Hackney, East London, as captured in the headlines of Hunter’s local newspaper, the Hackney Gazette. These startling, sometimes tragic, stories are retold in carefully staged photographs, whose compositions are frequently derived from paintings in the National Gallery. An essay by best-selling novelist Tracy Chevalier examines Hunter’s story-telling, while Colin Wiggins discusses the relationship between Hunter’s work and paintings in the National Gallery and elsewhere.",2005.0,3.58,80.0,40.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These four novels, each a miniature masterpiece, illustrate her development over four decades. Despite the seriousness of their themes, all four are fantastic comedies of manners, bristling with wit. Spark's most celebrated novel, THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE, tells the story of a charismatic schoolteacher's catastrophic effect on her pupils. THE GIRLS OF SLENDER MEANS is a beautifully drawn portrait of young women living in a hostel in London in the giddy postwar days of 1945. THE DRIVER'S SEAT follows the final haunted hours of a woman descending into madness. And THE ONLY PROBLEM is a witty fable about suffering that brings the Book of Job to bear on contemporary terrorism. All four novels give evidence of one of the most original and unmistakable voices in contemporary fiction. Characters are vividly etched in a few words; earth-shaking events are lightly touched on. Yet underneath the glittering surface there is an obsessive probing of metaphysical questions: the meaning of good and evil, the need for salvation, the search for significance.",2004.0,3.78,512.0,1456.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing exemplifies shopping more than the mall or shopping centre. It is the US's gift to personal consumption and the crossroad where consumer marketing, media and street culture meet. It is where the developed world (and increasingly everyone else too) goes to acquire, eat and hang out. It is where fashion trends are made dreams are constructed, and many people find their first jobs. The Call of the Mall is about sex and buying lingerie, about why the same camel coat costs exactly twice as much in the women's department to the men's, about why all mall food is so dreadful when the commodities in the shops are so good. Why location matters so much - but more for perfumes than DIY and why malls are invariably such bad architecture.

His animated theatrical features have been smash hits in Japan, and many, including My Neighbor Totoro and Kiki's Delivery Service, are already familiar to American audiences. Now, with Disney-Miramax's imminent release of Princess Mononoke,, Miyazaki's masterwork and one of the top-grossing film in all Japanese history, this ""animation master"" is about to take America and the world by storm. Mixing first-hand interview and personal insights with critical evaluations of art, plot, production qualities, and literary themes, McCarthy provides a film-by-film appraisal that examines technique as well as message. She reveals Miyazaki to be not just a master of the art of animation, but a meticulous craftsman who sees his work as a medium for shaping the humanistic and environmental concerns of our times. An overview of the artist and his early career is followed by in-depth examinations of seven major Miyazaki films: Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, Castle of Cagliostro, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Porco Rosso, and Princess Mononoke. Included are design and technical data, story synopses and character sketches, personnel and filmography data, and critical evaluation. Illustrations throughout, in color and black and white, show the detail and vigor of Miyazaki's art. Written for anime fans as well as students of film, literature, and popular culture, McCarthy's book raises animation criticism to a whole new level and is an essential guide to the work of a world-class filmmaker. London-based Helen McCarthy is author of Anime! A Beginner's Guide to Japanese Animation, The Anime Movie Guide, and (with Jonathan Clements) The Erotic Anime Movie Guide.

Originally published in 1989 by mass market publisher Ace, the book was marketed as generic sword and sorcery and, in the way of mass market books, disappeared from sight shortly thereafter, before it had a chance to reach an audience who would appreciate its themes. Based on an ancient Anglo-Scots ballad called ""The Famous Flower of Serving Men"" (a magical, tragic tale about a young woman who disguises herself as a man after the murder of her husband), Through a Brazen Mirror tells the tale of the witch Margaret, her daughter Elinor, King Lionel, and the extraordinary William Flowers, who saves the king from doom and Margaret's malevolent magic. With much richness of detail and folklore, Sherman uses the tale to explore issues of attraction, loyalty, and gender identity. For William is Elinor, who as William bonds with the young king and takes charge of a fate that was to be her undoing. The book, though it takes place in a fictional kingdom, is no cleaned-up fairy tale, and presents a historical picture of life circa 1400.

From ancient ivory carvings to the thriving tourist market, dolls and human figurines have played integral parts in the ritual, economic, and social lives of Native Alaskans. Dolls served as children’s playthings, represented absent community members at ceremonies, and predicted the movements of game animals for shamans. Not Just a Pretty Face surveys these and other uses of dolls and figurines, illustrating in beautiful color photographs the diversity of the doll-making tradition in Eskimo, Athabaskan, and Northwest Coast Native communities. Authors explore the ethnographic literature, twentieth-century oral histories, and photographic documentation of dolls and the doll-making process. Contemporary doll makers explain, in their own words, how they learned to make dolls and what doll making means to them. The second edition features a photo essay on Rosalie Paniyak of Chevak, one of the most influential doll makers in Alaska today. Not Just a Pretty Face provides a panoramic view of an ancient tradition and situates the art of doll making within a contemporary context.

Humphreys,Drama,http://books.google.com/books/content?id=AG4h-0aUbmwC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"A. R. Humphreyswas Professor of English at Leicester University. He also editedKing Henry IV Part 1and Much Ado About Nothing for the Arden Second Series,King Henry VandKing Henry VIIIfor Penguin, andJulius Caesarfor the Oxford Shakespeare. In the introduction to this Arden edition ofKing Henry IV Part 2, A. R. Humphreys begins by discussing the original publication of the play, the establishing of its date, and the extent to which Shakespeare took liberties with historical facts in 1and2 Henry IV. The editor proceeds to examine the relationship between the twoHenry IVplays, considering historical evidence and previous critical analysis. In the following section, Humphreys analyzes the several probable sources for the play, six of which appear in full in an appendix. Later in the introduction, the editor devotes substantial sections of his own criticism to the play's style and themes, with individual sections dedicated to Falstaff and the infamous scene of his rejection by Prince Hal. Humphreys finally dissects problems of the early texts, going over the nuances of the Quarto and Folio editions and comparing the two. Before the actual text of the play, notes are given on the particularities of this edition and its references and abbreviations. Following the text ofKing Henry IV Part 2are eight appendices: ""Source Material""; ""Hall probably not a Source""; ""II. i. 88: The Singing-Man of Windsor""; ""Justice Shallow and Gloucestershire""; ""Gaultree""; ""The Continuity of Scenes in Act IV, i-ii, and iv-v""; ""IV. v. 20-30: 'Why doth the crown lie there . . .'""; and ""Henry and the Crusade."" The Arden Shakespearehas developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play’s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader. Table of Contents Preface INTRODUCTION 1. Publication 2. Date 3.

It draws upon the research and biographical material of Anthony Cronin's No Laughing Matter, along with new research and criticism and takes issue with some of the conclusions reached in Keith Hopper's A Portrait of a Postmodernist. By tracing O'Nolan's development as an artist over time, this new study uncovers the relentless anatomist and post modernist in Flann O'Brien, a man of genius dissecting and exposing life and custom in mid 20th century Dublin. O'Nolan's views on the arts and the novel are carefully discussed along with his relation to the literary Ireland of the deValera years.",2002.0,5.0,222.0,1.0,High Rating,15300.78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this book, Sanderson, a renowned zoologist with a keen interest in the paranormal, puts forward the curious theory that âeoeOINTS""-Other Intelligences-live under the Earthâe(tm)s oceans. This underwater, parallel, civilization may be twice as old as Homo sapiens, he proposes, and may have âeoedeveloped what we call space flight."" Sanderson postulates that the OINTS are behind many UFO sightings as well as the mysterious disappearances of aircraft and ships in the Bermuda Triangle. What better place to have an impenetrable base than deep within the oceans of the planet? Yet, if UFOs, or at least some of them, are coming from beneath our oceans or lakes, does it necessarily mean that there is another civilization besides our own that is responsible? In fact, could it be that since WWII a number of underwater UFO bases have been constructed by the very human governments of our planet? Whatever their source, Sanderson offers here an exhaustive study of USOs (Unidentified Submarine Objects) observed in nearly every part of the world.

Lenz recorded a series of profound and powerful talks entitled Insights: Talks on the Nature of Existence. This book is a transcript of those talks. Rama was instructing an ever-growing number of students. Dr. Lenz himself was developing an approach to self-realization that, while emphasizing meditation and enlightenment, drew from a variety of traditions including Vedanta, Tibetan Buddhism and the American mystic teachings described by Carlos Castaneda. The Insights talks, which evolved from this time period, are like a crest jewel of Dr. Lenz's body of teachings. It is interesting to note that most of the Insights talks are subtitled ""Modular Mysticism"" (for example, ""Modular Mysticism: The Truth""). Even the talk titled ""How to Make Friends with God"" - discussed in depth only in this series - is termed a part of ""Modular Mysticism."" In the practice of mysticism, Dr. Lenz explains, the student begins to understand awareness and power. Modular mysticism becomes the science of power, and the student learns to gain power, to stop losing power, to store power, and eventually to give power to others. In order to gain power, the student begins to lead an efficient and well-structured life. As the student accomplishes this, they are able to move more easily through the doorways to enlightenment. At each step along the journey of the Insights talks, Dr. Lenz gives specific examples of how to adapt and integrate mystical Buddhist practice into a Western lifestyle. For Dr. Lenz there was no contradiction between being a successful Westerner and a successful Buddhist, be it building a career, working out at the health club, going to the movies, shopping for clothes -- or understanding why more women don't attain enlightenment (when, in fact, it's easier for them to do so).

After nursing her back to health, he was rarely seen without the amusing monkey on his shoulder. A ubiquitous presence in Bloomsbury society, Mitz moved with the Woolfs between their homes in London and Sussex. She developed her own special relationships with the family's cocker spaniels and with the various members of the Woolfs' circle, among them T. S. Eliot and Vita Sackville-West. Mitz even played a vital role in helping the Woolfs escape a close call with Nazis in Germany just before World War II. Blending letters, diaries, and memoirs, acclaimed novelist Sigrid Nunez reconstructs Mitz's life, painting it against the fascinating backdrop of Bloomsbury in its twilight years.
