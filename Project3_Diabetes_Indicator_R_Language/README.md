## Introduction
This Project is on the Diabetes Indicator. I have taken 3 datasets from the Kaggle website. 
Created 3 new files with only 50 records each. Combined them into one dataset and performed the diabetes analysis.
This Project is done in the ‘R’ language. The analysis gave us the idea of which factors are more likely 
to cause diabetes and share the results with everyone so that people will change their lifestyles accordingly 
to reduce diabetes problems in the future.


## Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:
1) Clone the repository
2) Create a virtual environment
3) Install dependencies

## Folder contents
In Total, this folder has 10 files. 

It consists of 3 original datasets taken from Kaggle website:
1) diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.xlsx
2) diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.xlsx
3) diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.xlsx

	Since these files are very big, only 50 records from each file are taken.

4) diabetes_binary.xlsx
5) diabetes_indicator.xlsx
6) DiabetesIndicator_5050split.xlsx

	These 3 files are combined into one dataset and performed diabetes analysis.

7) FinalProject_Step3_BasavaMadhuri.rmd is the code file in R language.
8) bibliography.bib  has the bibliography of the books.
9) FinalProject_Step3_BasavaMadhuri.pdf has all the analysis. 
10) README file.

## Run
run FinalProject_Step3_BasavaMadhuri.rmd file in RStudio.
