## Introduction
The Autism Prediction Project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on various demographic, behavioral, and medical factors. This project leverages data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning algorithms to create an effective predictive model that can assist in early detection and intervention for autism.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on individuals with and without autism, including demographic details, behavioral assessments, and medical history.

## Run
PythonCode_AutismPrediction.ipynb file in jupiter notebook.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing various metrics such as A1-A10 scores, age, gender, ethnicity,juandice,autism, etc. Ensure your data is cleaned and preprocessed before use.

## Model
The project employs several machine learning algorithms, including K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine), XGBRF (Extreme Gradient Boost-Random Forest), Cat Boost Classifier, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVC (Support Vector Classifier). The models are trained on historical data to predict the Autism.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, and confusion matrix.
