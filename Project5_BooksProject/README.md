## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to consolidate all the bookâ€™s data into records which I can store in the database to 
 serve the customers effectively as all the data will be in one place.
 First, I took the books.csv file downloaded from the internet and applied transformations. I cleaned the data as necessary 
 and saved it in a CSV file. Link to books.csv: https://www.kaggle.com/code/aiswaryarana/7k-books/input?select=books.csv
 Second, I scraped the website for book data and applied transformations to clean the data and format it as necessary.

 Third, I called APIs to get the book data based on the ISBN value, applied some transformations to it, and saved it to a CSV file.

 Fourth, I read all the above three CSV files into individual data frames, connected them to the SQLite database, and saved them
 into three tables.
 Fifth, I combined the three tables into a single table based on the common ISBN, created a data frame from it, 
 and applied visualizations.
