## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting Credit Card Fraud by creating models that can predict the likelihood of fraud based on the given features.

## Features
Predicts the likelihood of Credit Card Fraud based on user input.
Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for accurate prediction.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing various metrics such as Transaction Amount, V1-V28 that are the results of dimensionality Dimensionality reduction to protect user identities and sensitive features and class. 

## Model
The project employs several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Ada Boost, Cat Boost, XG Boost classifiers and Logistic Regression.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
