## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting Breast Cancer Survival by creating models that can predict the
likelihood of survival based on the given features and help them in every possible manner.

## Features
Predicts the likelihood of Breast Cancer Survival based on user input.
Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for accurate prediction.
