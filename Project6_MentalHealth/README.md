## Introduction
This is the Predictive Analytics Project done in Python. This project aims to properly identify individuals
in our community who require mental health treatment, provide early intervention, 
and deliver personalized mental health support. This is an achievable reality through 
the implementation of machine learning in mental health assessment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information on individuals with mental health conditions.

## Installation
To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:
1) Clone the repository
2) Create a virtual environment
3) Install dependencies

This folder consists of 4 files:

1) survey.csv is a dataset related to mental health data taken from the Kaggle website 
2) MentalHealthProject.ipynb is the jupyter notebook code file in python.
3) MentalHealthProject.pdf is the code file in pdf.
4) MentalHealthProject_Summary.doc is the Project summary file.

## Run
Run MentalHealthProject.ipynb file in Jupiter notebook.

## Data
The project uses a dataset containing various metrics such as age, gender, Family History, Treatments,etc

## Model
The project employs several machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, 
and Random Forest.

## Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC score.
